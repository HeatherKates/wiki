## What is SSH?

SSH (short for "secure shell") is a computer protocol for encrypting access to computers over a network. Typical use cases are:
* accessing HiPerGator and Serenity servers from a laptop or desktop machine, while on the UF network
* cloning, pulling, or pushing to GitHub repositories

## What software do I need?

SSH should be pre-installed with Mac OS, Windows 10, and Linux.
On other versions of Windows, you might want to download [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) which also contains some other useful tools.
