Based on this [Weather Station Maintenance guide](https://www.campbellsci.com/blog/et-station-components-to-maintain) from Campbell Scientific

####Every April and October:
 
-[ ] Inspect the solar radiation sensor. As needed, clean it using a soft, clean, damp cloth. If necessary, adjust the sensor to ensure it is level.

-[ ] Inspect the rain gage funnel and clean it as needed. Bring a bottle of clean water, remove the funnel, pour the entire bottle of water through the funnel in both directions to rinse.

-[ ] Clean the temperature/RH (radiation) shield using a soft, clean, damp cloth. If very dirty, remove shield and clean in soapy water, rinse with clean water, and let dry before reinstalling.

-[ ] Check that the wind sensor is still zeroed at true north.

-[ ] Check desiccant packs, moisture sensor and sealing putty in enclosure, replace packs if necessary (write date replaced with sharpie).


####Infrequent calibration and checks (more info in link above)

-[ ] Check seal on enclosure

-[ ] Recalibrate wind sensor

-[ ] Replace sensor element on humidity probe

-[ ] Recalibrate pyronometer (send to Campbell Sci)

-[ ] Recalibrate rain gauge sensor (send to Campbell Sci)

-[ ] Recalibrate pyronometer (send to Campbell Sci)
