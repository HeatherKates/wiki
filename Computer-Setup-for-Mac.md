This is an application on Macs. It is opened by double-clicking on the icon, which should bring up a small window with a black background. The Terminal is used to move around in the file directory, rearrange files, and use git.

_Installing git_

1. Open up the Terminal, type in "git" and press enter.

2. This should cause a pop-up window to appear. It will have several options; click on "Install" (not "Get Xcode", see "Installing Xcode" for that). 

3. Click "Agree". 

4. When the install is finished, click "Done". 

5. To make sure this worked, type in "git" in the Terminal and press enter. Some information will come up, including a list of common commands.

_GitHub_

Create a GitHub account by going to https://github.com/ 

This is a service that allows you to store your code, project management materials, etc., online. It allows for other people to look at your work (if the repo is public). It also saves all the versions of your code as you change it, which is referred to as version control. This eliminates the need for creating multiple copies of code as you change it (e.g., folder with files called "data_analysis", "data_analysis_3", "data_analysis_45", "data_analysis_final", and "data_analysis_final_really") and you can use the online GitHub interface to easily look back at previous versions of your code and see what was changed. 

_Repositories_

A repository is where you put all of the materials related to single project. One repository per project. 

Creating a GitHub repository:

1. Open up a browser, go to the GitHub website, and sign into your GitHub account. Navigate to your profile page.

2. Click on the "Repositories" tab in the top middle of the page. 

3. In the upper right hand corner, click on the green "New" button. 

4. In this page, name the repo, preferably something short and succinct that uniquely describes the project. 

5. Select if the repo will be public or private. Keep in mind that you have a limited number of private repos for free, so most of your repos will likely be public. Having your research publicly available also makes for better science. 

6. Check "Initialize this repository with a README". 

7. Leave both "Add .gitignore" and "Add a license" as "None". 

8. Click green "Create repository" button. You've created your new repository, congrats!
