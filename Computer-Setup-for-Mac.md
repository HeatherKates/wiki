_Installing git_

1. Open up the Terminal, type in "git" and press enter.

2. This should cause a pop-up window to appear. It will have several options; click on "Install" (not "Get Xcode", see "Installing Xcode" for that). 

3. Click "Agree". 

4. When the install is finished, click "Done". 

5. To make sure this worked, type in "git" in the Terminal and press enter. Some information will come up, including a list of common commands.
