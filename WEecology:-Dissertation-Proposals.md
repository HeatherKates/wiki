We believe that we should not require students to do things that do not have direct training benefits and that any training benefits inherently trade-off against the time, effort, and stress associated with an activity. Therefore, we use a proposal approach with direct training for real-life activities/interactions that is intended to minimize stress and wasted effort.

The standard dissertation proposal in the lab is to write a 5 page grant proposal in the style of an [NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503622). The goal of this short format proposal is to give you the opportunity to gain experience with grantsmanship, which typically involves clearly communicating nascent research ideas and feasibility in a clearly proscribed professional format that you may see in the future.

We also recognize that given the diverse career interests of folks in the labs that in some cases there may be different approaches to the proposal aspect of the PhD that are optimal given your interests. If you would like to discuss an alternative approach please let your advisor know.
