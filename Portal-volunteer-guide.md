# A volunteer's guide to Portal

## UF paperwork
  * If this is your first time volunteering, you'll need to complete this form: https://www.whitney.ufl.edu/media/wwwwhitneyufledu/images/files/UF-Record-of-Volunteer-Service.pdf
    * If you're not UF-affiliated, you'll need to get a UFID. One will be assigned to you by **RMD fill this in** 
  * Before we buy your flights, we need to submit a travel authorization. http://www.wec.ufl.edu/resources/travel/Travel%20Authorization%201.2.pdf
    * The RA can help you fill in estimates of your expenses. 
  * After the trip, submit a travel expense report with your actual expenses:http://www.wec.ufl.edu/resources/travel/Travel%20Expense%20Report%201.2.pdf
    * Include receipts for taxis/lyft, public transit fare, flights.

## Flights
  * You can fly in to Tucson any time from Thursday evening to mid-morning on Friday.
  * You can leave Tucson any time after Friday evening.


## Packing list (for a volunteer)
  * Depending on the month, it could be very hot (May-August) or very cold (November-March).
  * Hiking boots & socks
  * Sandals or flip flops
    * For cooler months, I recommend an extra pair of warm socks to go under your sandals
  * Hiking pants
  * Lightweight shorts for travel
  * 2-3 tshirts or tanktops
  * An overshirt to keep the sun off
  * A hat for sun
  * Sunblock
  * Sunglasses
  * Chapstick
  * 2 water bottles
  * A headlamp + batteries
  * Toiletries as needed

You can bring electronics, although there is a risk of them getting dusty or rained on. Verizon is the only carrier that really gets service at the actual site.


## Traveling logistics
### Flying
  * Your travel expenses will be covered.
  * Keep track of how much you spend getting to the airport (taxi, public transit fee, or gas + a per mile reimbursement if you drive your own car). You don't need to turn in your receipt unless you go over the per diem, but it's good to keep track.
  * Keep track of how much you spend on meals while traveling. You don't need to keep the receipts, but they can be helpful for keeping track of your expenses. The per diem is $3 breakfast/$6 lunch/$12 dinner. 
  * Depending on when you arrive, the rA will pick you up in Tucson in our field truck. There is also a hotel shuttle that can pick you up. You may need to go with the RA to pick up the field truck from its storage unit. 

### In Tucson
* Generally, the RA will pay for things because it's easier to keep track of the reimbursement that way. If you need to buy something, keep track of how much it was.
* Thursday night, we'll probably get dinner and then go back to the hotel.
* Friday morning, we'll go grocery shopping, fill up on water, and eat lunch in Tucson.
* It's a 3 hour drive to the site from Tucson. We'll stop halfway to fill up on gas. The travel stop has good bathrooms.

## Portal
### Alan
Alan is Morgan's dad. He often meets us at the site and helps with the census. He brings two of his dogs. They're medium size and vocal, but they mostly interact with Alan...
### Safety
* Stay hydrated! We bring lots of water, and we can go up the canyon to get more.
* Human health is more important than data. Take breaks when you need them.
* There are rattlesnakes, scorpions, and centipedes at the site. Be careful about sticking your hand into dense clumps of grass or under rocks. Stay alert for a rattle. We have gaiters we use to cover our ankles when we're walking around the site in the summer. Use a headlamp at night to avoid scorpions. Keep your shoes inside a tent/the truck, or make sure you shake them out before you put your feet in them. 
* There is a large woodrat midden in the corner of the ramada (our shed). We don't really touch it.
* Wash your hands after touching traps or rodents.
* If any food/utensils fall on the ground, don't eat it or use them.
* We've never had a problem with rodent-borne disease or parasites.
* There aren't any large dangerous predators at the site.
* There is pepper spray in the driver side door of the truck.
* We will not trap if there is > 50% chance of rain and the overnight low is goign to be < 45 degrees. This is to keep the rodents from getting too cold.

### Friday afternoon/evening
* We'll unpack the truck and set up our living space.
* About two hours before sunset, we'll head out to set traps.
  * In all, we trap 12 plots per night. Alan sets traps for four plots, and we do eight.
  * Some of the plots have 'gates', little holes to let the right set of rodents come and go. We have to close the gates before we set traps. Someone walks the perimeter of the plot and covers the gates with a bit of hardware cloth and a rock.
  * We set one trap at each of 49 stakes in each plot. Each trap gets a handful of millet and is placed facing a random direction, close to the stake.

### Saturday morning
* We'll get up about half an hour before sunrise to eat breakfast and get going.
* Bring a snack and water with you.
* As soon as there's enough light to see, we'll head out to check traps.
  * Alan typically starts collecting traps earlier than we do and puts full traps in a pile at the corner of each plot. If we catch up to him, we'll help collect traps.
  * **Rodent processing**
    * We'll need to open all the gates.
    * The RA will handle the rodents, and you will record data.
    * We tag the rodents by injecting a tag into the loose skin at the scruff of their neck. They don't like this, but we try to make it fast. 
    * Every month we have some rodents who got onto plots that they're not supposed to be able to access. We take them far away from the site and release them. You can process some of the 'exiles' if you want to, but there's no pressure to if you don't want to.

### Saturday afternoon/evening
* Is free time. We may have some maintenance to do.
* Two hours before sunset, we'll head out to set the second half of the traps.

### Sunday morning
* We'll get up before sunrise and have breakfast, then head out and process the second night of rodents.
* We'll put all the traps back in the trap shed, and pack up. 
* Usually we leave the site in the early afternoon to drive back to Tucson. We'll stop at the same gas station halfway through the drive.

### Sunday night/Monday morning in Tucson
* We'll stay at a hotel, depending on when our flights are. 
* We'll get dinner in Tucson. Breakfast is provided at the hotel.
