Welcome to the wiki where we collaboratively document how to navigate life in the lab (and beyond) from choosing and pursuing a career path, to writing and reviewing papers, to using the high performance computing system and the printer.

On the left you'll see the full list of sections and pages in the wiki. Click on a section (the large bold items) to see a list of all topics in that section, click on a page (the small not bold items) to go straight to the page, or type what you're trying to find in the search box.

To edit a page (if you're a member of weecology) just click the `Edit this page` link at the bottom of the page you want to edit and you'll be redirected to the GitHub repository backing this site so that you can edit.
