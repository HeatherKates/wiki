This guide is a general reference for being in the Weecology lab at UF. Some info is below, but much of it is actually located among the various lab-wiki pages, and linked to from here.

If you are a new member to the lab, please see the [issues](https://github.com/weecology/lab-wiki/issues) page of the lab wiki for the onboarding checklist. Make a new issue with your name and copy the list, and then be sure to go through it, referring back to the info here as necessary.

## General Lab Policies

### Lab Philosophy
See [Way of Weecology](https://github.com/weecology/lab-wiki/wiki/Way-of-Weecology).

### Lab Code of Conduct
See [here](https://github.com/weecology/lab-wiki/wiki/Code-of-Conduct).

### Software Project Code of Conduct
For software projects, repos should adopt a separate code of conduct for interactions with contributors. See [here](https://github.com/weecology/lab-wiki/wiki/Software-Project-Code-of-Conduct) for an example.

### Tea
Earl grey should almost always have milk in it! (though this is technically optional, per ISO 3103)

### Expectations / Annual Self-Assessment

See [here](https://github.com/weecology/lab-wiki/wiki/Annual-self-assessment) for more info.

### Slack and GitHub

- [ ] Markdown formatting
- [ ] Look through and subscribe to channels on Slack
- [ ] Basic commands in Slack (replies, responses, reminders, notifications for individuals/channel)
- [ ] GitHub repos (creating, subscribing, making issues, pull requests)
- [ ] Lab policies around using GitHub

### Calendars

Once you have your weecology.org Google account, you will have access to the lab calendars. You can access these from a web browser at [https://calendar.google.com/](https://calendar.google.com/). (**Note that you may need to use the account management button in the upper-right corner if you are logged in with other Google accounts at the same time.**)

Please keep your personal calendar up to date on when you will be out of town to help with scheduling meetings. Ethan & Morgan will have viewing access to your calendar. Some calendars you might want to add to your view to stay informed are:
* "ethan" (Ethan White)
* "morgan" (Morgan Ernest)
* "conference room"

The conference room schedule is maintained separately. You might need to contact someone who already has access to share the calendar with you.

### Lab Meeting

(for Spring 2018) Weds at 1pm ET.

Typical agenda is something like:
* general announcements
* short summary of past week from individuals present
* presentation of research (see [here](https://github.com/weecology/lab-wiki/wiki/Lab-Meeting) for the schedule)

## Contact Info

## Day-to-Day Operations

### Computer Setup

Tell Glenda if you need a new computer.

Here's a basic checklist for computer privacy and security. For more info, check out the wiki page on [Computer Security and Privacy Resources](https://github.com/weecology/lab-wiki/wiki/Computer-Security-&-Privacy-Resources)

- [ ] Get a password manager for your various website passwords.
- [ ] Set up 2FA where you can, and especially for important services like email and GitHub
- [ ] ^ Talk to Ethan or Glenda about getting a Yubikey for 2FA if you don't have one already
- [ ] Set up a SSH key for command-line access to GitHub. [instructions here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-ssh/)

#### Basic Software Setup

(Hao) I have this in my `~/.gitconfig` file to enable the `git lg` alias on command-line.
```
[alias]
lg1 = log --graph --abbrev-commit --decorate --format=format:'%C(bold blue)%h%C(reset) - %C(bold green)(%ar)%C(reset) %C(white)%<(40,trunc)%s%C(reset) %C(reverse white)- %an%C(reset)%C(bold yellow)%d%C(reset)' --all
