You can get a discounted rate thru Enterprise by booking the care thru this website  

https://procurement.ufl.edu/contracts/rental-vehicles/

Or the direct link to the Enterprise site

https://legacy.enterprise.com/car_rental/deeplinkmap.do?bid=028&refId=UNIFL

For personal rentals, you can skip most of the above details and just go to enterprise.com.  You get the UF discount by listing "Account Number FL43089" before paying.

If you rent a car and buy fuel for it, you need to put the rental agreement number on the pcard invoice for fuel.
