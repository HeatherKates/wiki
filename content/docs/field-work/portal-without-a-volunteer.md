**Doing Portal without a volunteer is currently suspended since Alan is no longer going**

In winter, when numbers are low, it's possible to do a Portal census without bringing a volunteer. 

## Trapping logistics
* For one person to set 12 plots of traps, start 4 hours before sunset. Renata moves the trap boxes and closes all the gates, and *then* starts opening traps. This means traps aren't open much longer than they would be if more people were setting. It takes about 1:45 to move boxes and close gates, and about 2 hours to set all the traps. Carry a headlamp with you when you go out to set traps, just in case. 
* Renata wears gaiters to set traps, even in winter, when alone. 
* Be extra conservative about rain. It seems miserable and extra risky to have to close traps at night alone. 
* It seems to take around 4 hours to process, more or less insensitive to the number of rodents - the real time sink is moving boxes around. 
* Scan the rodents in the bag, unless you're a real whiz at loading the PIT tag injector with one hand while holding a squiggly rat.
* You're probably doing this anyway, but make triply sure your phone is charged and keep it and the truck keys on your person. Be aware that cold is death to phone batteries.
* We haven't tried it recently, but it seems possible to do the entire census even without Alan. It would probably add at least 2 hours to processing to pick up the traps. One possibility is to trap over 3 nights rather than 2. To do this, we'd need to look at the schedule to get an even distribution of plot treatments over the 3 nights. 

## Travel logistics
* You can sleep at the site, up the canyon, or at the Portal lodge when out alone. The campsites up the canyon cost $20/night and this is enforced, so make sure you have cash. Sunny Flat is generally fairly well-populated; Stewart is a little more isolated. The Portal lodge closes for check-in at 6. 
* When camping alone, Renata sleeps locked in the cab of the truck. This has the advantages that: the windows are tinted, so it's not obvious that there's a person (esp. a WOC alone) in there; the truck is an official State of Florida vehicle; it is *locked*; pepper spray is readily available; it generally stays quite warm even in cold weather. As you can probably tell, Renata's risk tolerance re: strangers is low, but FWIW she's had numerous pleasant interactions with older couples out enjoying the National Forest and zero negative interactions around the town of Portal. 
* If weather dictates and your schedule is open, you *can* consider staying longer to trap on non-rainy nights. Make sure Alan is available/you're comfortable doing the whole thing alone before you change your flight.
