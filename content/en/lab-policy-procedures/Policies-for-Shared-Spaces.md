### Conference Room

Check on the conference room calendar to be sure the room will be available for your use. Add your meeting to the calendar to reserve a time.

### Video Conferencing



### Whiteboards

Material on whiteboards should be recorded (if needed) before leaving the room. Any whiteboard can be erased as needed. If erasing the material makes you nervous, you can always snap a picture just in case. But the responsibility lies with the group working on the boards to make sure they record their work.

### Coffee Shop

Tea and coffee are for general use, unless otherwise specified. Wash your dishes.
