## Coffee and Tea


## Dry Lab


## Fridge

Fridge space is shared among the lab members, and there is usually plenty of space for storing food/drink items. Here are some general guidelines and specific rules for the fridges:
* Do check occasionally for your old/forgotten items.
* Morgan and Ethan provide milk - give them a heads up on Slack if we are out.
* Fridges will be purged of items 3 times a year:
  - beginning and end of spring semester, and beginning of fall semester
  - announcements will be sent on the lab slack a week, 2 days, and 1 day before purges (if you need someone to save something in the fridge for you, let someone know)
* Fridges will be defrosted once a year:
  - simultaneously with the end of spring semester fridge purge

## Dry erase boards

If you create something on the conference room dry erase boards, it's your responsibility take a photo of it (or write a "save!" note) before you go.
