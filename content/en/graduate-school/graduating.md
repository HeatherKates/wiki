There's a lot of stuff to get done in the last semester or 2 of your PhD. Here are some tips.

## Are you finishing mid-semester to take a job elsewhere?
If you are not on an RA for a full semester, it can cause major issues with tuition waivers (the university will rescind your tuition waiver and ask you to pay out of state tuition). Talk with your advisor about how to manage this well in advance (i.e. BEFORE the semester you intend to start your new job). 

## Contact Claire Williams (WEC) or Karen Bray (SNRE)
As soon as you have a date for your dissertation defense that your committee agreed to, contact your deparment/school's academic advisor, and they will prepare the packet of forms you will need to have your committee sign. 

## Checklist
There are a ton of forms and things you need to do in your last semester. [Here](http://graduateschool.ufl.edu/graduate-life/graduation/graduation-checklist/) is a list of them. Most of these forms will be given to you by Claire, and will be given back to Claire once signed and completed. The ProQuest publishing agreement (different from the UF publishing agreement) is a little puzzling, and needs to be handed to the Editorial office directly by you (either in person or email-- instructions are on the checklist). Even though there is an "optional" section of this form about having ProQuest handle copyright registration of your dissertation for you, I was told UF can't be involved in this and you would have to contact ProQuest directly. Despite all this publishing stuff you've just signed, you will not be automatically given a bound copy of your dissertation. I was told I could order one from ProQuest [here](https://www.proquest.com/products-services/dissertations/).

## Look up examples
You can search for and download recent dissertations from your department here: http://cms.uflib.ufl.edu/etd/searchuf
That way you can see what an acknowledgements section and a "bio sketch" are supposed to look like.

## The Dissertation
Formatting will be annoying. There's an office to help you/tell you you're doing it wrong. They recommend downloading the dissertation template [here](http://helpdesk.ufl.edu/application-support-center/graduate-editorial-office/) and just pasting your own text into the appropriate sections. They seem to be moving pages around on their help website and breaking links all the time, but at this moment there are some examples of things like table of contents [here](http://graduateschool.ufl.edu/about-us/offices/editorial/format-requirements/).
### First Submission
Despite what they say, your dissertation doesn't need to be "done" by first submission. You just need to have some words in all the parts for them to check the formatting. Mine was missing an acknowledgements section: that was one of the things they told me I needed to change. However the more complete your dissertation is at this point, the easier final submission will be.
### Final Submission
Your dissertation really does have to be done for final submission. Make sure you corrected all the things they flagged on your first submission, and your committee has all signed off on this version.

## Clear Prior
Clearing prior basically means that you have completed all of the requirements to graduate after the final submission deadline has passed and you will graduate the next semester (i.e., finishing by the clear prior deadline in summer 2020 will let you graduate in fall 2020). If you meet the clear prior deadline, you are exempt from the standard rule that you need to be registered for at least 3 credits in the semester in which you graduate. You are, however, still _allowed_ to be registered for credits and be paid as an RA; you are simply exempted from the normal rule if you choose. 

The way this works behind the scenes is that the editorial office with confirm that you've met all the requirements for clear prior (first submission [regular deadline], final submission and final acceptance/clearance by the clear prior deadline). Notice that you've met the clear prior requirements will then be sent to the graduate school offices. If you are not registered for any credits, you will be verified as clear prior. If you _are_ registered for credits, they will reach out to confirm whether you want to remain registered for credits or be verified as clear prior. For example, if you want to continue being paid as an RA and, therefore, need to be registered for credits, then you will not be verified as clear prior and have basically just met all of the next semester's (your graduating semester) deadlines very early. 

## Exit seminar
You will be giving an exit seminar to the department during WEC's usual seminar time. I recommend making this as close as possible to your actual defense date with your committee -- theoretically your committee will go to your talk and then be prepared for your defense. As of Fall 2018 they are using a zoom room to record all the talks, which means you can invite people to join remotely with the link. It will also hopefully be recorded -- you can email Tom Barnash and he will give you a link to the recording (I have been unsuccessful at getting a downloadable file).

## Commencement
* You have to order regalia from the bookstore pretty early in the semester (i.e., deadline is in October for Dec. graduation)
* Your diploma will be mailed to the address indicated in your ONE.uf account -- make sure it's correct

## Odds and ends
* If you had a pcard, close it out by emailing the pcard team (pcard@ufl.edu) a few days before your last day. They will cancel it and you are supposed to shred it yourself. 
* Don't forget to leave your lab key, and any computer equipment you've been using
