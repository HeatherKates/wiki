Tips and Advice for doing your job from a location other than the lab

### Productivity



### Communication

* Communicating in text is difficult and awkward. So:
    * Be thoughtful about what you write and how it conveys your message. Avoid misunderstandings by making your message as clear as possible from the beginning.
    * Try not to take things personally
    * Give others the benefit of the doubt

* Do not hesitate to go to video if it would serve the conversation better than text
