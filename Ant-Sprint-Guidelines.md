# Data Entry

* Use Template file
* Month, Day, Year Columns:
   * Split the date into the appropriate column
   * Keep an eye on the date. Different plots will be surveyed on different days
* Plot:
 * Plot # (sometimes called pen #) will usually be at top of page. Sometimes two plots are recorded per page
* Stake data:
   * Depending on the year, stake is recorded as a letter/number combo or numbers.
   * Do not hyphenate or capitalize stakes (e.g. c1 not c-1 or C1, 11 not 1-1)
* Species names: 
 * Displayed either across top or in column titled 'other' (some years do not have the other column)
 * If displayed as full species name (Genus species): enter first 4 letters of genus and species names (e.g. Pheidole xyloni = Phei xylo)
 * If already shortened, enter the shortened version (Ph.x.) but do not include . (e.g. Ph.x. = Phx)
* Number:
 * This is the number of colonies. Enter the number given.
* Notes in parentheses need to be dealt with differently depending on what they are: 
 * Either records the number of openings seen (e.g., (3)) or location (3m NW G1).
 * (number): enter under Parentheses column
 * (location): enter under Notes

* **Ask**: This is old eccentric data. Ask Erica or Morgan if you have any questions

## Weird(er) Things

* Solenopsis/solA/solB
 * only records prescence. So no numbers just stakes
 * stakes make be records as a1-a7
 * when entering, enter each stake number separately and put count as 1
 * Count looks like: 1(3);1(2): combine the values into one entry: count = 2, parenthese = 5
