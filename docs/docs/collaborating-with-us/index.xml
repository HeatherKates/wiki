&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://cancer.ufl.edu/research/shared-resources/biostatistics-computational-biology-shared-resource/biostatistics-shared-resource-support-request-form/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Online Support Requet Form&lt;/a>:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Fill out the support request form as best you can. The important thing is to get connected with us, we&amp;rsquo;ll learn much more about your project later.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="schedule-a-meeting-with-us">Schedule a Meeting With Us&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Once we receive your support request, we&amp;rsquo;ll send you an email to schedule a meeting. Initial meetings are usually about an hour long, during which we want to understand your project and the expectations of a future collaboration.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-does-the-funding-work">How Does the Funding Work?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The BCB-SR is a group of bioinformatics scientists whose salaries are primarily funded by effort on the grants on which they collaborate. Because of this, the ideal scenario is that you identify the need for bioinformatics collaboration &lt;strong>before&lt;/strong> your grant is submitted so that there will be an appropriate allocation of funding. If this is not the case, we will estimate our effort given the project&amp;rsquo;s needs and determine whether the project has sufficient funding available to support bioinformatics collaboration.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Who We Are</title><link>https://ufhcc-bcbsr.github.io/wiki/docs/collaborating-with-us/how-to-work-with-us/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ufhcc-bcbsr.github.io/wiki/docs/collaborating-with-us/how-to-work-with-us/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="who-we-are">Who We Are&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Each of us at BCB-SR Bioinformatics is driven by the mission to bridge the gap between data and discovery. We are all trained as biologists as well as bioinformaticians, and take a biology-first view of bioinformatics analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="careers">Careers&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Want to work as a bioformatician at UF? We&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you to support your career development. You can search for jobs at &lt;a href="https://explore.jobs.ufl.edu/en-us/listing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Careers at UF&lt;/a> using broad search terms including &amp;ldquo;data&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;analyst&amp;rdquo;, as not all programs realize that what they are looking for is a &lt;em>bioinformatician&lt;/em>!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
