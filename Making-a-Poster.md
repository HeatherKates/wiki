Here is some information on how to print your poster at UF:

Poster dimensions are limited in one direction to 36 inches. They charge $3 per foot for the other dimension, so a typical poster that is 36" x 48" would cost $12. 

The location of the printing room for posters is Rm. 118 in the Architecture building. Don't actually go into the architecture building as you'll get lost. The room can is accessed from the outside on Inner Rd (see map below). Another option is to go to Rm. E235 in Marston Library.

You can also print posters on fabric, to avoid having to carry a poster tube while traveling. They can be done at [Spoonflower](https://www.spoonflower.com/welcome) for ~$20 + $3 shipping, but shipping takes 6-9 days so the poster would need to be prepared well in advance. See their directions [here](https://support.spoonflower.com/hc/en-us/articles/204266984-How-to-Create-a-Fabric-Presentation-Poster-from-a-PowerPoint-or-PDF).
