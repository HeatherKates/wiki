Here is some information on how to print your poster at UF:

There are even some templates at the bottom, in powerpoint format with the correct dimensions for the printer, where you can just fill in your own research.

The location of the printing room for posters is Rm. 118 in the Architecture building. Don't actually go into the architecture building as you'll get lost. The room can is accessed from the outside on Inner Rd (see map below). Another option is to go to Rm. 224 in The Hub.
