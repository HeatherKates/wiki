We are super excited that you’re joining us. (We only take people into our group that we are super excited about!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This onboarding checklist is designed to help you get up to speed and integrated with our group. It is a general reference for being in the Weecology lab at UF. Some info is below, but much of it is actually located among the various lab wiki pages, and linked to from here. It is not perfect. If you get stuck or confused, make sure to reach out to someone! Good people to contact probably depend on what exactly you’re confused about, but here are some suggestions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The newest member of the lab group you are joining has probably recently struggled with whatever you are struggling with.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Glenda Yenni. She knows everything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Computer or Software related? Henry Senyondo is a good bet!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ethan or Morgan (we’re always here to help).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shy about asking anyone? The lab wiki itself has a lot of answers. Check out the bar to the left and see if one of the existing pages might have what you’re looking for.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>If you are a new member to the lab, you should complete the Onboarding Checklist included at the bottom of this page. Go to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/weecology/wiki/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issues&lt;/a> page of the lab wiki and look for an issue assigned to you with the onboarding checklist. If there isn&amp;rsquo;t one, ask Glenda to create one for you, or make a new issue with your name and copy the list from the issue template, and then be sure to go through it, referring back to the info here as necessary. We’re always trying to improve the onboarding experience, so keep track of the things that you wished there was more information on or anything confusing. You’ll get a chance at this end of the onboarding checklist to suggest improvements!&lt;/p>

Here are some tips for how to handle this. [Using R]&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="getting-the-right-sizeresolution">Getting the right size/resolution&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Journals often have size limits and recommended resolution for figures (e.g. no more than 6 in wide and 7 in tall, 600dpi resolution). Good news: if you use the ggplot2 package to make plots, you can then save your figures using &lt;a href="http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsave.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ggsave()&lt;/a>! There are options for width, height, and dpi. And since the resulting file will almost certainly be larger than the journal&amp;rsquo;s size limit, use the argument compression=&amp;lsquo;lzw&amp;rsquo; to make it smaller.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="multi-part-figures">Multi-part figures&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have found the package &lt;a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/multipanelfigure/multipanelfigure.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multipanelfigure&lt;/a> to be very useful. It allows you to make a multi-part figure by putting together any kind of objects: ggplot figures, base R figures, pngs, whatever. There is a fairly easy to understand example on their &lt;a href="https://github.com/cran/multipanelfigure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub repo&lt;/a>, and I used it in &lt;a href="https://github.com/emchristensen/Extreme-events-LDA/blob/master/rodent_LDA_analysis.r" target="_blank" rel="noopener">line 188 of this script&lt;/a>. The general idea is you create a grid object with the function multi_panel_figure(), in which you specify things like size of columns/rows:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>grid_object &amp;lt;- multi_panel_figure(width = c(50,50), height = c(50,50))&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and then fill the grid one cell at a time&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>grid_object %&amp;lt;&amp;gt;% fill_panel(ggplot_figure, row = 1, column = 1)&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>grid_object %&amp;lt;&amp;gt;% fill_panel(png_path, row = 1, column = 2)&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can then use the function save_multi_panel_figure() which is similar to ggsave(), and again specify dpi and compression. Getting it to the right size is harder, I ended up playing around with column and row sizes until it fit.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Submitting a manuscript</title><link>http://localhost:1313/docs/publishing/manuscript-submission/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/publishing/manuscript-submission/</guid><description>&lt;p>Congrats! You&amp;rsquo;re getting ready to submit a manuscript for review at a journal. This guide will walk you through the various steps in the process, however, it assumes you&amp;rsquo;ve already decided what journal to submit to. Right now, there is no wiki page on that, so talk with Ethan or Morgan or one of the postdocs/staff for advice.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="manuscript-formatting">Manuscript Formatting&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Go to the journal&amp;rsquo;s website, and they should have a section called &amp;ldquo;For Authors&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Author Instructions&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Guide to Authors&amp;rdquo; or something along those lines. They should have detailed guidelines for citation style, section order, cover letter requirements, submission website link, etc. They will also, hopefully in the same location, have a description of the focus of the journal, which your manuscript should fall within.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The journal may have document templates (most commonly for Microsoft Word or LaTeX). If you are working in LaTeX, you may want to consider &lt;a href="https://www.overleaf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overleaf&lt;/a>, which has some built-in templates for journals. If you are working in Rmarkdown, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/rstudio/rticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;code>rticles&lt;/code>&lt;/a> package also has some common templates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using a citation manager that can format references using Citation Style Language (CSL) is highly recommended. Many styles can be found or modified from existing ones at &lt;a href="https://www.zotero.org/styles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zotero&amp;rsquo;s CSL list&lt;/a>. Many Rmarkdown outputs accept CSL files to format references.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://localhost:1313/docs/publishing/headings">Use real headings&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="recommending-reviewers--editors">Recommending reviewers &amp;amp; editors&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Journals typically ask you to recommend 3 or more people who could potentially review your manuscript. Those people may or may not end up being reviewers, and they might not even be asked, but providing a good list will help increase the chance that the review process starts quickly and that you get good feedback from relevant reviewers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s probably most important to recommend scientists who have similar philosophies to yours (e.g., if the paper has a macroecological approach, don&amp;rsquo;t choose someone who thinks fieldwork is the only way to do ecology).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t recommend anyone who could have a conflict of interest. The idea is that people who would be biased by personal or institutional relationships to the authors should review the paper. Typically this is considered to include anyone at your current institution and anyone who&amp;rsquo;s been a (close) coauthor on a paper with any of the current manuscript&amp;rsquo;s coauthors in the last 5 - 10 years or so. You should ask coauthors to check the list of reviewer recommendations to conflicts before submitting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some journals will also ask for editor recommendations. There should be a page on the journal&amp;rsquo;s website with the editorial board, choose 1 - 2 associate editors that seem most appropriate, based on the manuscript topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some journals will also allow you to designate reviewers with &amp;ldquo;conflicts&amp;rdquo; or something similar. This is not a list of people who have a conflict of interest as described above. It is an opportunity to designate people that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to review the paper because they are predisposed to review it negatively (e.g., they are directly competing with you in the research space, or have known objections to certain topics/approaches). We basically never list people, but if you are concerned about someone chat with your advisor.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cover-letter">Cover letter&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>All cover letters consist of:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>a business header (either the name of Editor in Chief &amp;amp; their professional address or your name and professional address) (if you forget this part it is not a problem and choosing one header or the other won&amp;rsquo;t raise any eyebrows though to the editor is more traditional)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a description consisting of the manuscript title, authors, and what &amp;rsquo;type&amp;rsquo; of article it is being submitted as for consideration (e.g., Report, Methods, Ideas and Concepts, Article, this varies from journal to journal and some journals do not have different types of article)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a brief description of the manuscript (typically 1 paragraph). For many journals, this description should convey either implicitly or explicitly why this article is of interest to the specific readership of this journal. If going to a general ecology journal like Ecology/Ecology Letters/AmNat then this description should focus on the aspects of your work that a general readership would find interesting. If going to GEB then focus on the general interest and global nature of the study. etc etc. If you are going for one of the journals whose mission is to publish what they think is the most influential research (Science, Nature, PLoS Biology, PNAS, eLife) then you need to emphasize the novelty and importance of the work and more than 1 paragraph may be acceptable (see the Riemer example below).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any assurances or statements the journal requires (i.e. the work is the authors&amp;rsquo; own, it is not submitted elsewhere, etc).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Your letter should not be longer than 1 page, including the header material and your &amp;lsquo;signature&amp;rsquo; at the bottom (don&amp;rsquo;t need to literally sign it).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are some examples of cover letters&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/sdtaylor/phenology_dataset_study/blob/master/manuscript/cover_letter.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cover letter&lt;/a> for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2568" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taylor et al. 2018&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="../cover-letter-first-submission.pdf">Cover letter&lt;/a> for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27166" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Riemer et al. 2018&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="data-and-code-archiving">Data and Code Archiving&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Recommendation: Archive your code on &lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zenodo&lt;/a> using the &lt;a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub-Zenodo integration&lt;/a>. Archive any data that hasn&amp;rsquo;t already been archived and that you have permission to archive (typically based on the license allowing &amp;ldquo;redistribution&amp;rdquo; or based on permission from the data collector) on either Zenodo (by archiving it along with the code) or separately on &lt;a href="https://datadryad.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dryad&lt;/a> (linking to the relevant code through Dryad). Have your code download the already-archived data from the archival source instead of archiving it again. If the journal has open data/code badges, indicate that you want to use them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Discussion: Most journals now require the sharing of the code and data used for analyses in a paper. Even in cases where it isn&amp;rsquo;t required this is good for science through supporting reproducibility and building on existing work. Availability of data and code also increases use and citation of papers. There are a variety of locations to archive data. In ecology, general purpose repositories are the norm for most data. Zenodo and Dryad are both non-profits focused on the good of science with good sustainability models. They are also both common locations for archiving so choosing them will avoid any confusion about whether or not the data is properly archived. &amp;ldquo;Archive&amp;rdquo; implies that the data/code will be available in the long-term through guarantees to maintain the infrastructure hosting the data/code and not allowing the person depositing the data/code to remove it. The ability to remove code from GitHub means that GitHub is not considered archival.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="funding-sources">Funding sources&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Recommendation: Follow journal and funder guidelines for acknowledging funding sources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Discussion: Funding agencies require that when their funds are used for research that this funding is acknowledged. Journals have two general approaches to doing this: 1) listing the funding in the Acknowledgements section; 2) having a separate component of the submission process where funding sources are acknowledged. Funding agencies often have specific requirements as well. Check with your advisor &amp;amp; collaborators in the sources that funded the work (you may not always be aware of the different sources) and also make sure to acknowledge any support that was made directly to you (e.g., individual fellowships). Check the funders requirements for for acknowledging their funding or follow an example of a previous paper from the lab with the same funding source.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="opentransparent-review">Open/Transparent Review&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Recommendation: Participate in open/transparent review.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is increasingly common for journals to post reviews and author responses to those reviews online with a paper if it is accepted for publication in the journal. Some journals are also exploring posting reviews even for manuscripts that aren&amp;rsquo;t accepted. The goal is to increase the transparency of the overall scientific process and provide accountability for journals and authors if they have had an important issue pointed out to them that they haven&amp;rsquo;t addressed. Reviewers are typically given the option to remain anonymous. Generally speaking we think open, but anonymous, review history is a positive development and recommend opting in even if it is not required, but this is still a developing area and individual lead authors are welcome to not opt-in (or opt-out if allowed) if they wish after consulting with coauthors.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="submission">Submission&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Your formatted manuscript and cover letter will get uploaded to the journal&amp;rsquo;s author submission website. There will also be some web forms where they will ask for reviewer/editor suggestions, probably make you enter co-author info (that is already on your cover sheet, but try not to think about the redundancy in the process). Click submit and now you wait for the response, which is often in the 1-2 month, but sometimes closer to 3 months.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="preprints">Preprints&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Recommendation: Submit preprint to bioRxiv at time of first submission to a journal and update the preprint whenever you submit a revision of the manuscript (either as part of ongoing review or to a new journal after rejection). Check the journals preprint policy (in either the instructions to authors or on &lt;a href="https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sherpa Romeo&lt;/a>) just to make sure they are allowed (though preprints are now allowed basically everywhere) and get sign off from coauthors to post a preprint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Discussion: All major journals in ecology that we are aware of now allow posting preprints prior to submission (in part due to &lt;a href="https://jabberwocky.weecology.org/?s=preprint&amp;amp;submit=Search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weecology efforts&lt;/a>). They are good for science and professionally beneficial to both early career and established scientists (e.g., &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001563" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Desjardins-Proulx et al. 2013&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1511912112" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vale 2015&lt;/a>). Benefits to putting up preprints include the possibility that more people will see your work, it will be able to influence the field sooner (as it can takes months or years for papers to be published), it can start to accumulated citations (currently used as a form of academic credit), and you could get valuable feedback to improve the manuscript. Some of this depends on how actively you promote the preprint by sharing on social media, disseminating to other scientists, etc. Journals also identify preprints of interest and could reach out to you about publishing with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, all of our grants include statements that we will submit preprints, so if you decide you do not want to submit a preprint or a coauthor does not want to agree to this please talk to the relevant PI of any grants that have supported you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a variety of preprint servers, but we almost universally use &lt;a href="http://biorxiv.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bioRxiv&lt;/a>. It has become the standard location in the field and is run by a non-profit organization. Some journals only allow preprints posted to non-profit pre-print servers making it a good choice and it is a good player in ensuring science is available to all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We typically submit the initial preprint at the same time as the initial submission of the manuscript to the journal. This will probably take 1-2 hours. To keep the preprint up to date and ensure that it satisfies funder mandates for open archiving it should be updated whenever the manuscript is resubmitted (either as part of a revision or to a new journal).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sharing-work-on-social-media">Sharing work on social media&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>(info to be included: tone/style; tagging institutions, co-authors, funders; figures and alt-text; links to preprint and code/data)&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="dealing-with-reviews">Dealing with reviews&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When you get your reviews back, the next step is to figure out how to handle them. Typically reviewers will have major and minor criticisms. Your task is to sort through those criticisms and figure out a plan for addressing them. Reviewers are only human and they are not infallible. Their criticisms will fall into one of three categories: useful, neutral, and wrong. You are not required to do everything a reviewers tells you to do. Ethan and Morgan&amp;rsquo;s philosophy (which we got from our advisor) is that if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t harm the research/manuscript you do whatever a reviewer requests (i.e. everything in the neutral/good categories). If you think what the reviewer has suggested is majorly problematic, then we generally advise not doing it. In your response to the reviewers you can explain why you disagree with their suggestion/criticism. You want to choose judiciously when to stand your grand in the review process. Discussion with your co-authors/advisers is warranted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you resubmit your manuscript, you will also submit a detailed response to the reviewers. To construct this, cut and paste the reviews into a new document. Into this document you will write your response to each individual issue the reviewer brings up. Often reviewers will construct their reviews so that each paragraph is focused on a separate distinct issue, if not, you can break their paragraphs accordingly. Keep all of their comments in the document so it is clear you did not edit out any of their concerns. We find that a good starting place for your revision is sitting down with the document and thinking about how you would/should respond to each of these items and start writing in ideas/responses. Then you can use your responses as a template for making the changes in your manuscript.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Examples of Response to Reviewers:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://localhost:1313/docs/publishing/point-by-point-response.pdf">Response to reviewers&lt;/a> for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000125" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yenni et al. 2019&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="response-to-editor">Response to editor&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When you resubmit you will also submit a cover letter to the editor. This is distinct from the detailed response to reviewers. The cover letter will consist of 2 main parts:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>a statement similar to the first one in your cover letter stating the name of the manuscript and the authors and that you have revised your manuscript and are resubmitting it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a paragraph overviewing the changes you made in response to the reviews - in this paragraph you only really need to discuss what seem like the major concerns - especially if the editor highlighted them in their decision letter.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Do not forget your co-authors through this process. You do not have to go through this on your own. They can help you brainstorm how to deal with difficult issues, help run analyses to deal with concerns, help draft language for the response letter or implement revisions to the manuscript.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully you have a good relationship with your co-authors and they are actively engaged, however often co-authors are more peripheral to a project (e.g., had a limited role in the analyses/manuscript). It can be easy to forget them as you manage all the moving parts of the review process. Professionally, however, you need to make sure they are OK with the manuscript during all the phases of this process. To do this we recommend following the &lt;a href="http://localhost:1313/docs/publishing/collaborative-writing/">Collaborative Writing Guide&lt;/a>. Regardless, you must ALWAYS have all co-authors sign off on the final version of the manuscript before submitting.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lab Reading List</title><link>http://localhost:1313/docs/getting-started/lab-reading-list/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/getting-started/lab-reading-list/</guid><description>&lt;p>[This page is still a work in progress]&lt;/p>

Every topic contains an overview paper (i.e. if there&amp;rsquo;s only one paper you read on a topic, read that one) and several &amp;ldquo;deep-dive&amp;rdquo; papers. Every new member to the lab should read all the overview papers for all the topics and the deep-dive papers for the projects relevant to them (especially if they are funded off a grant working in that area).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After a manuscript has gone through the review process it will be returned with a decision. These generally fall into the following categories:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Accepted - The paper is accepted in it&amp;rsquo;s current form. This never happens on the first round of review.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Revisions requested - This generally means that the paper has a very good chance of being accepted assuming that you can successfully respond to review comments.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rejected, but OK to resubmit - This is what used to be called &amp;ldquo;major revisions&amp;rdquo; and indicates that while there were meaningful concerns that may involve a significant revision the journal is definitely still interested in publishing the paper. Except in exceptional circumstances you should revise and resubmit to the same journal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rejected, without the possibility of resubmission - Very common due to journal scope, perceived importance of the paper, and artificial scarcity imposed by journals, but also due to serious concerns about methods or interpretation. Except in exceptional circumstances the next step is to submit to a different journal.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="actively-involve-co-authors">Actively involve co-authors&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When you receive the reviews and response from the journal, forward it on to your co-authors, even if you are not yet ready to discuss how to handle the comments. If you wait, you&amp;rsquo;ll forget and then you&amp;rsquo;ll be racing a deadline to resubmit without having co-authors engaged.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is encouraged to discuss the plan for responding to reviewer critiques with co-authors. Depending on the specifics of the collaboration, different approaches to this may be warranted. You may draft the response to reviewers (see below) and send them out for comments. During the drafting process you may also assign specific comments to specific co-authors if the criticism is pertinent to their role on the manuscript.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ALWAYS get co-authors to sign off on the final version of the response and manuscript before resubmitting.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ALWAYS share the good news when a manuscript is accepted. Everyone likes good news. :)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="revising-the-manuscript">Revising the manuscript&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When you get your reviews back, the next step is to figure out how to handle them. Typically reviewers will have major and minor criticisms. Your task is to sort through those criticisms and figure out a plan for addressing them. Reviewers are only human and they are not infallible. Their criticisms will fall into one of three categories: useful, neutral, and wrong. You are not required to do everything a reviewers tells you to do. Our philosophy is that we make the changes that improve the manuscript as well as any that are neutral. We try to avoid making changes that make the manuscript worse, though there are occasionally strategic tradeoffs to consider.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The response to review will be composed of three parts:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>A point by point response the reviewer comments&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The revisions to the manuscript itself&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A letter to the editor stating general what you&amp;rsquo;ve done&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>We recommend proceeding in this order. First developing a draft of the point by point response to reviewer comments and sharing and discussing it with your co-authors to get everyone on the same page about what to do in response to the reviews. Second, following the point by point document, implementing the changes to the manuscript that you have planned. Third, writing the letter to the editor.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="response-to-reviewers">Response to reviewers&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is where you explain in detail the changes that you have made in response to the good and neutral comments and also why you disagree with the recommendations that you think would make the manuscript worse. It is also common for reviewers to recommend that you do some new analysis that expands the current manuscript. It is OK to explain that these kinds of expansions of the topic of the paper are out of scope for the current manuscript.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Read through the reviews and then don&amp;rsquo;t work on them for a few days. This will help you respond more positively to the reviews when you revisit them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Copy all of the review comments into a single document with a subsection for each reviewer and the editor if the editor provides specific comments. Keep all of their comments in the document so it is clear you did not edit out any of their concerns and reviewers and editors don&amp;rsquo;t have to jump back and forth between review and response documents to evaluate your response.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After each distinct comment (often reviewers will construct their reviews so that each paragraph is focused on a separate distinct issue, if not, you can break their paragraphs accordingly) write a response describing what you are going to change in the manuscript, analysis, etc. or what is wrong with the suggestion or that the change is out of scope.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Pay attention for cases where the reviewer comment itself isn&amp;rsquo;t helpful, but indicates a failure to communicate clearly in the current manuscript. In these cases you should revise the manuscript to avoid similar confusion on the part of readers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you have drafted this, share and discuss it with your co-authors before starting the revise the manuscript itself. This will ensure that everyone agrees on how the paper will be revised (or at least that everyone has had the chance to object to your proposed approach before you do the work). To accomplish this the draft needs to include specific changes that you plan on making, not just general statements that you will make changes in response to a comment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Examples of Response to Reviewers:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="revisions-to-the-manuscript">Revisions to the manuscript&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Once everyone agrees on the general form of the response use this response document to guide the revision of the manuscript. This may include adding new analyses, changing existing analyses, modifying figures, and revising the written manuscript.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most journals will require you to submit a version of the manuscript with the changes from the previous submission tracked, so make sure you are working in such a way that you can create this at the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="response-to-editor">Response to editor&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When you resubmit you will also submit a cover letter to the editor. This is distinct from the detailed response to reviewers. The cover letter will consist of 2 main parts:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A statement similar to that in the cover letter from the initial submission stating the name of the manuscript and the authors and that you have revised your manuscript and are resubmitting it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A paragraph providing an overview of the changes you made in response to the reviews. This paragraph should focus on the major concerns in the reviews, especially any concerns that the editor highlighted in their decision letter. This is your opportunity to briefly explain what positive changes you made in response to the review and to provide a big picture reason for the things you didn&amp;rsquo;t change. This can really set the tone for how the response to reviewers is read by the editor.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Committee meetings usually only need to be an hour long.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It can be very tricky to find a time when all committee members are free (especially if there are 5 of them because of WEC). The process below is one way this can happen:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Email all members to ask which days within a 1-2 month range they&amp;rsquo;re completely busy/traveling/unavailable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a schedule form to figure out the specific times each member is available, restricting this to the days in which everyone is not completely unavailable. We recommend [When Is Good] (&lt;a href="http://whenisgood.net/%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://whenisgood.net/)&lt;/a>. On the website, you create a calendar of possible days and times.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Use 30 minute blocks of time so that you have the best chance of finding time that fits everyone&amp;rsquo;s schedules (given UF&amp;rsquo;s class schedule available often doesn&amp;rsquo;t line up with the hours of the day evenly).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Check Morgan and Ethan&amp;rsquo;s weecology calendars to block out times with any meetings and classes already scheduled.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The site creates a link to the calendar of available times.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Email this to all committee members, and ask them to fill it out by clicking on their available times (which will turn green).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After everyone has filled it out, you access the calendar with a unique code that shows how many and which members are available for each time period. If you&amp;rsquo;re lucky, there will be at least one time period during which everyone is free.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Email all the members back letting them know what time the meeting is and where it will be held.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Send a reminder email 24-48 hours in advance that includes an agenda.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="rooms-that-can-be-reserved-for-meetings">Rooms that can be reserved for meetings&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In Newins-Ziegler, rooms 135 or 376. Person to contact to reserve the room is Elaine Culpepper (&lt;a href="mailto:birdrule@ufl.edu">birdrule@ufl.edu&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>You send out your dissertation to the committee no later than 2 weeks before the defense date.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 week before the defense I will send an email to the committee letting them know how we&amp;rsquo;ll manage the defense (see below).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 day before your defense, you send out a reminder to the committee.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Day of: every defense has a life of its own. Because the exit seminar is so disjunct from the defense, we like to have the students prepare a short presentation (aim for ~ a 20-30 minute overview split evenly among the chapters). This helps make sure everyone&amp;rsquo;s pointed the right direction. We&amp;rsquo;ve done this with going around the room one by one asking questions but I like to have questioning open during the talk. It makes it more conversational and reduces pressure on committee members to &amp;ldquo;perform&amp;rdquo; for the other committee members when it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;their turn&amp;rdquo;. At the end of your talk, we&amp;rsquo;ll open it up for any last questions. Like with the quals/proposal defense, we&amp;rsquo;ll have you step out of the room (virtually) so that the committee can make sure we&amp;rsquo;re on the same page. If this takes a while it&amp;rsquo;s because it&amp;rsquo;s been a long couple of years and we haven&amp;rsquo;t seen each other in a while and probably has nothing to do with you :simple_smile:. Then you&amp;rsquo;ll come in, give your talk, answer questions,. We&amp;rsquo;ll have you step out when we&amp;rsquo;re done with questions. The committee will share thoughts. Then we&amp;rsquo;ll bring you in and let you know what the consensus was and what you need to do to the dissertation (if anything) for a) submitting to the grad school and b) submitting to a journal. If this was in person, you&amp;rsquo;d want to make sure you have all your paperwork present and we&amp;rsquo;d sign at the end and that would be it. Karen will either send a form via DocuSign or it will be passed around via email.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>On the process for incorporating committee edits:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have never heard of needing to re-defend a dissertation - not saying that it never happens, just that I’ve never been at an institution where that occurs. Typically if the committee decides edits/reanalysis is necessary what happens is the committee will decide at the meeting if the committee members want to see a revised version or if they are minor/straightforward enough that the advisor can sign off on the revisions. If they are minor then you’ll make the changes, I’ll look them over and I will sign off for the committee. If they are major, then you will work with the committee member with the concerns to fix them - following their suggestions and making sure they are happy with things before the committee signs off. After the defense, all the discussion typically occurs ad hoc and does not require the entire committee to meet again.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Obtaining Florida Residency</title><link>http://localhost:1313/docs/graduate-school/florida-residency/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/graduate-school/florida-residency/</guid><description>&lt;p>When you start at UF you won&amp;rsquo;t be a Florida resident for tuition purposed (unless you already lived in Florida), and that is fine . Various graduate handbooks and forms say you must apply for Florida residency for tuition once you qualify, which is possible after living here for 1 year. This is important because &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://www.sfa.ufl.edu/cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Out-of-state graduate students should add $17,394 to projected tuition/fees&lt;/a>.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you have been a resident of Florida for a year, you can petition to be reclassified as a Florida resident for tuition purposes. This happens through the registrar&amp;rsquo;s office, and involves a lot of paper. Basically, you gather all the documents you can find that have your name, a Florida address, and a date at least one year ago, and hand in a packet to the Registrar. I think the site says you need at least two documents, but it&amp;rsquo;s much better to be over-prepared (if they deny your petition you may appeal, but this takes a long time and it&amp;rsquo;s best to avoid it).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is UF&amp;rsquo;s official website about this: &lt;a href="https://admissions.ufl.edu/cost-and-aid/residency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://admissions.ufl.edu/cost-and-aid/residency&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The documents that worked for Erica were: (everything should be a copy, they won&amp;rsquo;t return these things to you)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Florida drivers license&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Voter registration card&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Apartment lease (the whole thing, not just the cover page)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Utility bills for past 12 months&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Renters insurance policy&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://localhost:1313/docs/graduate-school/florida-residency-how-to.pdf">This document&lt;/a> is from an IFAS Dean and outlines some of the official guidelines with links to the relevant Florida laws. Note that it states you cannot apply for residency if you only came to Florida for school. Yet this is the case for everybody in the Weecology lab, and everyone who has applied for residency has gotten it.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The people checking this read the law to the letter, which is something like &amp;ldquo;Legal documents showing residency of 12 months prior to the start of the semester&amp;rdquo;. After talking with a few people it seems the easiest way to do this is, as soon as you move to Gainesville and &lt;strong>before your 1st semester starts&lt;/strong> go get your Florida drivers license, car registration, and register to vote. At the start of your 2nd year here these will then be legal docs that are dated 12 months from the present. If you really want to drive it home you can also do the Declaration of Domicile along with your license, voter registration, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shawn first submitted the following and got denied:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Florida DL (not 12 months old, I got it in October my 1st semester).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most recent UFL paystub.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Graduate assistantship letter from Ethan (showing the beginning date of 1 year prior).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1st page of my lease (dated more than 12 months prior).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>He went thru the appeal process and got approved submitting the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>My &lt;em>full&lt;/em> 12 page lease (My thinking was the 1st page was not a &amp;ldquo;legal document&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>12 months of rent check copes that my bank saves online.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Here is the form for residency reclassification: &lt;a href="https://registrar.ufl.edu/pdf/residencyreclass.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://registrar.ufl.edu/pdf/residencyreclass.pdf&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Renata submitted these and got denied twice:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Full lease starting July before my first semester&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Florida DL&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vehicle registration&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Letters of offer &amp;amp; appointment
The second time also&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Copies of my rent checks starting in July before my first semester&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I then called the Registrar and found out I also needed to provide my tax return (proving I filed as an independent and paid my own living expenses). They waived it for me and approved my reclassification, because as a grad student they knew I must be filing as an independent(?), but for anyone new it is good to know. The language in the form confused me - it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you&amp;rsquo;re older or younger than 24, you need to submit a copy of your most recent tax return.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Graduate Funding Opportunities</title><link>http://localhost:1313/docs/graduate-school/funding-opportunities/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/graduate-school/funding-opportunities/</guid><description>&lt;p>You will typically enter the lab with guaranteed funding from a combination of Research Assistantships (RAs; to work on grant funded research), Teaching Assistantships (TAs; helping to teach college courses), and University Fellowships (conceptually support to work on your own research, but at UF these typically also include a TA requirement).

You&amp;rsquo;re beginning to think about defending and graduating! You maybe asking yourself: What should I do? You’re in the right place. Start with:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="planning-your-defense-date">Planning your Defense Date&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Think about what semester you are aiming at and why.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The why is important. Do you have a job to leave for? That is a slightly different conversation/set of constraints than hitting the end of your funding or just being ready to leave.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>*Remember: Morgan and Ethan will not do defenses between May 15th and August 15th, so take this into consideration. There are some work arounds if you need to finish in the summer but they will require the Clear Prior route (see FAQs below).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do you want to finish mid-semester to take a job elsewhere? If you are not on an RA for a full semester, it can cause major issues with tuition waivers (the university will rescind your tuition waiver and ask you to pay out of state tuition). If this is part of your plan, it can be dealt with but when you talk to your advisor about your plan (step 3 below) make sure to bring this up!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Make a draft timeline&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This is important because it will help you understand where you are in the process and what issues there may be with your preferred timeline.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To make a draft timeline go to the &lt;a href="http://graduateschool.ufl.edu/about-us/offices/editorial/editorial-deadlines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grad school editorial deadlines website&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Find the semester you want to graduate (i.e. receive your diploma). Find the entry that says “Final Submission”. If your preferred semester is in the summer, you should pick the ‘Clear Prior’ date for the semester &lt;strong>before&lt;/strong> your preferred semester. In either case, this is the date by which everything needs to be submitted - all paperwork, including the final format dissertation and defense paperwork.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Construct your ‘drop dead timeline’. This timeline is the latest you can do everything and still have a chance to submit by the Final Submission date. This gives you the maximum amount of time to finish everything, but also gives the minimum amount of time for committee review and for you to do edits after your defense. This is not the timeline to aspire to, but it is the timeline that will get it done.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>defense deadline: what is the date 2 weeks before ‘final submission’? This is the late day your defense can be scheduled and still have time to do edits for final submission.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>full dissertation draft to committee deadline: what is the date two weeks before your defense deadline? This is the last date to have your full dissertation (an introduction chapter, 3 scholarly chapters, and a conclusion/tying it all together chapter to your committee in near final formating. Remember, this deadline is asking your committee to probably read 100+ pages in less than 2 weeks when they are already super busy. Your committee wants you to succeed and they will do this for you if this is what you need, but it will not fill them with joy and happiness.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Assess your completion state relative to the timeline
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Do you feel good? Hyperventiliatory? Pessimistic? Whatever you feel, please proceed to step 3, even if you think it’s impossible. Your advisor is experienced and creative. They may think of things that you haven’t realized yet that will make this more possible.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Talk to your advisor&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>At least 2 semesters before you want to graduate, talk to you advisor. Hopefully the two of you have had a few conversations about this starting in your 4th year, so this shouldn’t be a big deal. Tell them what you’re thinking, walk them through your timeline, and tell them how you feel about your timeline given the state of each of your chapters. The two of you will work through options that make sense, brainstorm possible solutions to any issues, and come to consensus on the best timeline for you.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Talk to your graduate program coordinator&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Now that you and your advisor agree on a semester for graduation, contact Karen Bray (SNRE) or Ivette Hernandez (WEC) depending on your graduate program. They will make sure your grad school requirements are complete and that you aren&amp;rsquo;t missing anything vital. Do this as soon as the semester you wish to graduate is clear to you in case you are missing credits.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Check with your committee&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Let your committee know that you are starting to plan your defense. Give them a brief update on the status of your chapters (attach any chapters that have been published or submitted). Let them know what your tentative timeline is (i.e. a defense no later than your drop dead date) and ask about any known conflicts during a 1 month window up to your drop-dead defense date.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Set your defense date&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>chat with your advisor about dates your committee is available for a defense. Committee availability may require some rethinking about your schedule, especially if the drop-dead deadline was already going to be difficult. Notify your committee as soon as your advisor and you agree on the date so that they can put it on their calendars.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Schedule your exit seminar&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Both WEC and SNRE require an exit seminar. It does not have to be the same semester that you defend, but it must occur before you can graduate.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Congrats! You are now officially in the endgame of your dissertation! The next phase involves finishing up your dissertation, formatting it for UF, and presenting it to you peers and committee.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="navigating-the-bureaucracy">Navigating the Bureaucracy&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There’s a lot of bureaucracy at UF related to graduating. This list provides tips for navigating the various forms, deadlines, and formatting rules related to getting to this end part of your process.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Initiate the graduation process&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Contact Ivette Hernandez (WEC) or Karen Bray (SNRE) as soon as you have a date for your dissertation defense that your committee has agreed to, contact your deparment/school&amp;rsquo;s academic advisor, and they will prepare the packet of forms you will need to have your committee sign.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Stay on top of deadlines!&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There are a bunch of deadlines for the grad school and you do not want to miss them! Check on the &lt;a href="http://graduateschool.ufl.edu/about-us/offices/editorial/editorial-deadlines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grad school editorial deadlines website&lt;/a> and emblazon them somewhere.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are going to Clear Prior, make sure you are following the deadlines for the semester &lt;em>before&lt;/em> you intend to graduate.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Download the &lt;a href="http://graduateschool.ufl.edu/graduate-life/graduation/graduation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">checklist&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There are a ton of forms and things you need to do in your last semester.Most of these forms will be given to you by the graduate coordinator, ( who you will also turn them back to once they are signed). The ProQuest publishing agreement (different from the UF publishing agreement) is a little puzzling, and needs to be handed to the Editorial office directly by you (either in person or email&amp;ndash; instructions are on the checklist). Even though there is an &amp;ldquo;optional&amp;rdquo; section of this form about having ProQuest handle copyright registration of your dissertation for you, I [Ellen] was told UF can&amp;rsquo;t be involved in this and you would have to contact ProQuest directly. Despite all this publishing stuff you&amp;rsquo;ve just signed, you will not be automatically given a bound copy of your dissertation. You may be able to order one from ProQuest &lt;a href="https://www.proquest.com/products-services/dissertations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Formatting your dissertation&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There are a variety of sections that you don’t normally have in a paper that you need for a dissertation (Acknolwegdments, Introductory and Concluding chapter, etc). Seeing examples can be helpful. You can search for and download recent dissertations from your department here: &lt;a href="http://cms.uflib.ufl.edu/etd/searchuf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://cms.uflib.ufl.edu/etd/searchuf&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Formatting will be annoying. There&amp;rsquo;s an office to help you/tell you you&amp;rsquo;re doing it wrong. They recommend downloading the dissertation template &lt;a href="https://it.ufl.edu/helpdesk/graduate-resources/ms-word--latex-templates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a> and just pasting your own text into the appropriate sections. They seem to be moving pages around on their help website and breaking links all the time, but at this moment there are some examples of things like table of contents &lt;a href="http://graduateschool.ufl.edu/about-us/offices/editorial/format-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>First Submission&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>UF requires a draft of your dissertation be turned in very early during the semester you intend to graduate (or defend for Clear Prior). Despite what they say, your dissertation doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; by first submission. You just need to have some words in all the parts for them to check the formatting. Mine was missing an acknowledgements section: that was one of the things they told me I needed to change. However the more complete your dissertation is at this point, the easier final submission will be.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>) Final Submission&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your dissertation really does have to be done for final submission. Make sure you corrected all the things they flagged on your first submission, and your committee has all signed off on this version.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="clear-prior">Clear Prior&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Clearing prior basically means that you have completed all of the requirements to graduate after the final submission deadline has passed and you will graduate the next semester (i.e., finishing by the clear prior deadline in summer 2020 will let you graduate in fall 2020). If you meet the clear prior deadline, you are exempt from the standard rule that you need to be registered for at least 3 credits in the semester in which you graduate. You are, however, still &lt;em>allowed&lt;/em> to be registered for credits and be paid as an RA; you are simply exempted from the normal rule if you choose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The way this works behind the scenes is that the editorial office with confirm that you&amp;rsquo;ve met all the requirements for clear prior (first submission [regular deadline], final submission and final acceptance/clearance by the clear prior deadline). Notice that you&amp;rsquo;ve met the clear prior requirements will then be sent to the graduate school offices. If you are not registered for any credits, you will be verified as clear prior. If you &lt;em>are&lt;/em> registered for credits, they will reach out to confirm whether you want to remain registered for credits or be verified as clear prior. For example, if you want to continue being paid as an RA and, therefore, need to be registered for credits, then you will not be verified as clear prior and have basically just met all of the next semester&amp;rsquo;s (your graduating semester) deadlines very early.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="exit-seminar">Exit seminar&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You will be giving an exit seminar to the department during WEC&amp;rsquo;s usual seminar time. I recommend making this as close as possible to your actual defense date with your committee &amp;ndash; theoretically your committee will go to your talk and then be prepared for your defense. As of Fall 2018 they are using a zoom room to record all the talks, which means you can invite people to join remotely with the link. It will also hopefully be recorded &amp;ndash; you can email Tom Barnash and he will give you a link to the recording (I have been unsuccessful at getting a downloadable file).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="commencement">Commencement&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You have to order regalia from the bookstore pretty early in the semester (i.e., deadline is in October for Dec. graduation)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your diploma will be mailed to the address indicated in your ONE.uf account &amp;ndash; make sure it&amp;rsquo;s correct&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="odds-and-ends">Odds and ends&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Inform Donna that you will be ending your position well in advance.
This will help make sure that everything that needs to happen for you to end your UF position happens smoothly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you had a pcard, close it out by emailing the pcard team (&lt;a href="mailto:pcard@ufl.edu">pcard@ufl.edu&lt;/a>) a few days before your last day. They will cancel it and you are supposed to shred it yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to leave your lab key, and any computer equipment you&amp;rsquo;ve been using&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Single transaction limit – The amount one single charge cannot exceed. Ours is $2,000.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cycle limit – The amount that can be charged in the weekly cycle (Wed through Tue). Ours is $10,000.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Purchases cannot include sales tax if in Florida or with vendors with UF agreement (eg Amazon).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Can be used for travel costs (flights, car rentals, gas for business travel, etc)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>CANNOT be used to purchase food or drinks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>NEVER EVER EVER use for personal use. There is no &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll payback the University for this&amp;rdquo;. This includes putting gas in a personal vehicle, even if it&amp;rsquo;s for work travel.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you&amp;rsquo;re leaving UF, cancel your pcard by just emailing them (&lt;a href="mailto:pcard@ufl.edu">pcard@ufl.edu&lt;/a>) on your last day, and they will have you shred the card yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="getting-a-pcard">Getting a PCARD&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You need to go through pcard training. This involves watching a number of videos.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Step 1: Go to myUFL, then navigate to My Self Service &amp;gt; Training and Development &amp;gt; myTraining. To search for the PCard courses, click in the Activity Search box, then enter the appropriate course name or number.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As a PCARD holder, you will need to take the following courses: UFGO500 and UFGO100&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you finish your training submit the &lt;a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=-KBNDTFKdk2s5gpiMx4bhGicOwDMKeFOrgQpJC5WLa1UOVNKQkdRWkVEODdRMzQ4NUdYVjFGOE1CMiQlQCN0PWcu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WEC PCARD APPLICATION FORM&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once WEC receives your request the following process will take place:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>WEC will fill out the Pcard Application with the information you provide in this form&lt;/li>
&lt;li>WEC will collect required signatures&lt;/li>
&lt;li>WEC will submit Pcard Application to pcard team on your behalf (pcard team requires Dept approval)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pcard team will notify you when the card has been ordered&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can expect to receive the card in about 15 days after.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You will receive an email from WEC instructing you to pickup your pcard&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In reality, processing takes a few weeks to a month. You may need to go in and specifically ask for it if you don&amp;rsquo;t get an email.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once you receive the card, activate it and set a PIN:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Call 8882338855&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your account number is the credit card number&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your &amp;ldquo;Verification ID&amp;rdquo; is 0 followed by your UFID&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The phone number associated with the account is 352 392 1331.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This information is in the email from the PCard office that tells you your application was approved. You won&amp;rsquo;t get a separate piece of mail with a PIN.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="general-info">General Info&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This section is for general info commonly needed for PCard Purchases&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Billing Address: University of FLorida, PO Box 110430, Gainesville FL 32611-0430&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Billing Phone Number: 352-392-1331.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PCard are now Chip and Pin cards, so you may need your PIN when using the card in stores.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you use with a PIN, the vendor may ask for a p number/project code/somesuch thing. You can just say the name of the project it&amp;rsquo;s for, it&amp;rsquo;s not a specific value.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="using-the-pcard">Using the Pcard&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So you&amp;rsquo;re taking the big step and actually going to use the PCard. Not to scare you but the PCard is a big responsibility and the University takes using them correctly very seriously, so make sure to follow the flowchart below!&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Are you purchasing for yourself, or someone else?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Never loan anyone your P Card, or give them your P Card information to use - this could result in a suspension&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You are welcome to purchase items or travel for others, just do it yourself. There are fields on the travel and P Card forms to provide information on who you&amp;rsquo;re purchasing for and why.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Are you making an item purchase (i.e. an object like a keyboard, paper, etc) or a travel related purchase (i.e. flight, registration, etc)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Item Purchase: Jump to Step 3&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Travel Purchase: You need to also have a Travel Authorization submitted so that the travel costs can be associated with the travel approval. Go to the Travel page and follow those instructions. Before proceeding to step 3.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Are you in a store or buying on the web?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Store: Jump to step 4&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Web: Make sure that the site is not going to charge you sales tax. If it is you must stop immediately. There are other ways of purchasing from online vendors. If the vendor is on myUF MarketPlace (found on myufl) then you can follow &lt;a href="http://hr.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/instructionguides/Using%20PCard%20in%20myUF%20Market.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these guidelines&lt;/a>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>AMAZON - STOP! - Amazon items must be purchased via the punchout on myUF MarketPlace. Do not use your P Card on Amazon.com, you could get your P Card suspended.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Otherwise, talk to Glenda about purchase orders through the department. If you are still making your online purchase, billing address can be found under general info. Proceed to step 4.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You are in a store. Are you in Florida or out of state?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Florida: The University of Florida is exempt from paying sales tax and gets irritated about paying it. You need to make sure you have the tax exempt card with you so the store knows not to charge you sales tax. You should have received a card with your pcard but if not you can get one &lt;a href="http://www.fa.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/disbursements/fa-pds-cce.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a> . Show them your card and proceed to step 5.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Out of State: Stay calm and carry on. Sales tax charges are ok if purchases are made out of state. Proceed to step 5.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I have my thing, now what?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You have three, yes 3, days to submit your receipts to WEC.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Complete the &lt;a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=-KBNDTFKdk2s5gpiMx4bhGicOwDMKeFOrgQpJC5WLa1UMFZaV0ZaQjRIOFRSTE1RMUtXNTFWTkFXMyQlQCN0PWcu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PCARD RECEIPT SUBMISSION FORM&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most of the form is self-explanatory. But putting some time into the description and justification will make your life easier. The staff really likes it if pcard holders are very clear about what the purchase is so taking time to fill in that section in the form goes a long way (i.e. if the vendor name is confusing or the items seem like they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be allowed on the grant).
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You can only put items on a sponsored project (a specific project-related grant) if the item will without question only be used for that project. Computers and computer supplies are especially difficult to justify. There is always department money that can be used for these items if it&amp;rsquo;s questionable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you&amp;rsquo;re purchasing travel for someone else, make sure you put it on a chartfield they are allowed to work on (usually one they are paid from)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Please describe how the items will be used for the chartfield being charged.&lt;/em>: Take care to provide a thorough justification of why the item is needed
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No: computer supplies&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yes: Cables and communication equipment will be used in the field to communicate with project team members on project goals&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Chartfield to Charge&lt;/em>: You can get this from Glenda if you don’t know it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Benefit to Funding Source&lt;/em>: Provide a clear explanation as to how the items will benefit the chartfield you listed above
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No: field work&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yes: Tools for field site maintenance and saftey&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Attach a picture of the receipt at the end of the form.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are traveling, I would recommend taking a picture as soon as you get the receipt in your hand. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to lose receipts. Trust me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you buy fuel for a rental car, you need to include the rental agreement number in the email.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Did you lose your receipt?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>People will be unhappy with you but it is not the end of the world. You need to fill out this &lt;a href="http://www.wec.ufl.edu/resources/fiscal/Replacement_Receipt_Form_2009-08.doc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">form&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The form requires your supervisor (Ethan or Morgan) to sign it. You will receive the stank eye from a variety of people. You will survive.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I took longer than 3 days to submit my documentation&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You have likely gotten several emails from concursolutions warning you you have overdo expenses, just go ahead and submit the form ASAP.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If WECfiscal sends you get a notification that you are out of compliance on your P Card let Glenda, Morgan or Ethan know.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>It is possible to temporarily increase the purchasing limit on your card if needed.

&lt;p>Posters are often end up being a wall of text. If you want to experiment with a new poster design, watch this &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/1RwJbhkCA58" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube video&lt;/a>. The first half of the video is making an argument for why the &amp;rsquo;traditional&amp;rsquo; poster design is ineffective, slows down knowledge transfer, and makes poster session less enjoyable for everyone. The new poster design is showed in the second half of the video if you want to just skip ahead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[note: should upload a copy of a traditional scientific poster]&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="printing-the-poster">Printing the Poster&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Here is some information on how to print your poster at UF:
&lt;a href="https://print.at.ufl.edu/help/frequent-printing-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://print.at.ufl.edu/help/frequent-printing-questions/&lt;/a>
&lt;a href="https://print.at.ufl.edu/help/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://print.at.ufl.edu/help/pricing/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Poster dimensions are limited in one direction to 36 inches. They charge $3 per foot for the other dimension, so a typical poster that is 36" x 48" would cost $12.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The location of the printing room for posters is Rm. 118 in the Architecture building. Don&amp;rsquo;t actually go into the architecture building as you&amp;rsquo;ll get lost. The room can is accessed from the outside on Inner Rd (see map below). Another option is to go to Rm. E235 in Marston Library.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can also print posters on fabric, to avoid having to carry a poster tube while traveling. They can be done at &lt;a href="https://www.spoonflower.com/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spoonflower&lt;/a> for ~$20 + $3 shipping, but shipping takes 6-9 days so the poster would need to be prepared well in advance.

Therefore, we use a proposal approach with direct training for real-life activities/interactions that is intended to minimize stress and wasted effort.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The standard dissertation proposal in the lab is to write a 5 page grant proposal in the style of an &lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503622" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="https://www.ogrants.org/grants-03-programs#u-s-national-science-foundation-nsf-postdoctoral-fellowship-in-biology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Good examples of this type of proposal&lt;/a> can be found on &lt;a href="https://ogrants.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://ogrants.org&lt;/a>. The goal of this short format proposal is to give you the opportunity to gain experience with grant writing skills, which typically involve clearly communicating nascent research ideas and feasibility in a clearly proscribed professional format that you may see in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also recognize that given the diverse career interests of folks in the labs that in some cases there may be different approaches to the proposal aspect of the PhD that are optimal given your interests. If you would like to discuss an alternative approach please let your advisor know.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="timing">Timing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Some time during years 2-4 of the PhD program, typically during year 3. This is far enough into your program for you to have thought thoroughly about your research and make a plan to base the proposal on.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="steps-for-the-proposal">Steps for the Proposal&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>At least 2 months before your qualifying exam discuss your plan for your proposal with your advisory.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Draft your proposal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At least 1 month before your qualifying exam given your draft proposal to your advisor for feedback.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At least 2 weeks before your qualifying exam send your proposal to your entire committee.&lt;/li>

Therefore, we use a qualifying exam approach with direct training for real-life activities/interactions that is intended to minimize stress and wasted effort.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We believe that a good assessment of having the breadth and depth of understanding necessary to be a professional scientist is the ability to hold a scientific conversation about your research with other researchers and stakeholders. Can you talk about how your research fits into the current state of the field? Can you explain the choices you&amp;rsquo;ve made with respect to data and analyses? Can highlight how your research differs from the current state of the field, conceptually and in its strengths and weaknesses? This mirrors real world interactions like questions during presentations, chalk talks on job interviews, and interacting with others online about your scientific products.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore our qualifying exams focus on a discussion of your research centered on your &lt;a href="../dissertation-proposals">proposal&lt;/a>. They are typically scheduled for 1.5 hours and will be conversational in nature. You should prepare a short presentation to remind your committee members of that material in your proposal and provide a starting point for the conversation. Beyond writing your proposal and preparing the presentation no additional studying specific to the exam is necessary.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="snre-students">SNRE Students&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>SNRE has a very flexible policy related to qualifying exams, which allows us to design our own approach. Based on principles outlined above we use a qualifying exam that is a single 2 hour oral discussion (no written component) where the committee engages in a discussion with the student about the student’s research. You provide &lt;a href="http://localhost:1313/docs/graduate-school/dissertation-proposals/">your proposal&lt;/a> to the full committee at least two weeks before the qualifying exam to help committee members focus their questions. We don&amp;rsquo;t restrict how the questions relate to the proposal, for example, questions can be conceptually or methodologically focused, involve justifying your approach/hypothesis, or asking you to provide more background on a concept or theory you are using for your research. The goal is for the exam to closely reflect something that we all regularly have to do with reviewers, colleagues, and collaborators: explain and justify our research ideas.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="timing-of-qualifying-exams">Timing of Qualifying &amp;ldquo;Exams&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Some time during years 2-4 of the PhD program, typically during year 3. This is far enough into your program for you to have thought thoroughly about your research and allow to you write a proposal.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="steps-and-for-qualifying-exams">Steps and for Qualifying &amp;ldquo;Exams&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>At least 1 month (and ideally 2-3) before you want to do the &amp;ldquo;exam&amp;rdquo; poll your committee for available dates and times.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At the time you poll your committee remind your advisor to send an email explaining the exam format to the committee.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once you have a two hour block that works for everyone schedule a room. This can be the unconference room if it&amp;rsquo;s available (home territory, lots of white boards, good remote access; what&amp;rsquo;s not to love).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Notify your committee about the scheduled time and remind them of the structure of the &amp;ldquo;exam&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At least 1 month before the &amp;ldquo;exam&amp;rdquo; send your proposal to your advisor for feedback.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At least 2 weeks before the &amp;ldquo;exam&amp;rdquo; send your revised proposal to the entire committee.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you send your proposal to the committee remind your advisor to email them to remind them about the exam format.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The day before the &amp;ldquo;exam&amp;rdquo; send a reminder to your committee of the time and location.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The morning of the &amp;ldquo;exam&amp;rdquo; send a reminder to your committee of the time and location (yes, this seems excessive, but you&amp;rsquo;d be surprised how many times we&amp;rsquo;ve had issues with committee members not showing up.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>An SNRE committee needs to have at least 4 people. Three committee members need to be SNRE Affiliate Faculty, which means they must be on their &lt;a href="https://snre.ifas.ufl.edu/people/affiliate-faculty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of faculty that are officially SNRE faculty&lt;/a>. The fourth member can (optionally) not be affiliated with SNRE, but must either faculty at UF in a academic department or be a Special Member from outside UF who &amp;ldquo;brings special expertise related to student’s dissertation research.&amp;rdquo; To appoint a Special Member to the committee you need to consult with the SNRE Academic Advisor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If there is more than one UF faculty member who you would like to serve on an SNRE committee, any UF faculty can become SNRE affiliated by sending a letter to the SNRE Academic Advisor. They must be approved, which can take a few months. If you want to pursue this option make sure you start early so that the relevant faculty member becomes an affiliate before you need to take your qualifying exam.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The SNRE forms say that 50% of your committee cannot be from the same department, but historically this has not been enforced.&lt;/p>

In this case it is possible to substitue another faculty member for the committee member who cannot make it.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Substituting members at qualifying and final examination: If a supervisory committee member cannot be present at the student’s final defense, a Graduate Faculty member in the same academic area may substitute for the absent committee member. The substitute should sign the Final Examination form on the left side, in the space provided for committee members, noting the name of the absent member.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The chair of the student’s major academic unit also must indicate the reason for the absence and state that the absent member agreed to this substitution at the final examination.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The substitute should not sign the ETD signature page. The original committee member must sign.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Do not pay for gas with a Pcard unless you have a state vehicle or rental. Fuel in a personal vehicle can only be paid through a mileage calculation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The amount of per diem you can claim is based on your actual travel times. (eg If you are flying, it is based on your actual departure and arrival times.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can only get reimbursed for tipping taxi/Uber/Lyft drivers up to 20%.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are special rules for conferences, see the conference section below.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is possible to add personal travel to UF travel, see the personal travel section below.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The travel process at UF can be broken down into 3 major steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Travel Request&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Booking travel&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Travel Expense Report (TER, being reimbursed for travel)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="travel-request">Travel Request&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Fill out the &lt;a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=-KBNDTFKdk2s5gpiMx4bhGicOwDMKeFOrgQpJC5WLa1URVFSV0ExNkExTzFNM1EzNUxZTlZMRjZRNyQlQCN0PWcu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TRAVEL REQUEST / BLANKET TRAVEL REQUEST FORM&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of the form is self-explanatory.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Please provide justification for essential travel: Take care to provide a thorough justification of why the travel is needed
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No: field work&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yes: Travel to field site to collect data and perform maintenance&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chartfield to Charge: You can get this from Glenda if you don&amp;rsquo;t know it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Benefit to Funding Source: Provide a clear explanation as to how the travel will benefit the chartfield you listed above
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No: field work&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yes: LTREB data collection for monitoring and forecasting&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meals (Unless travelling internationally): Choose
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Meal rate - Domestic (36.00 Per Day)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meal type - Personal Funds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Estimated Meal Amount - 36*days (this is the maximum, actual amount will be calculated after travel)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>International Travel&lt;/strong>: See &lt;a href="https://www.fa.ufl.edu/directive-categories/international-travel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL&lt;/a> to ensure you&amp;rsquo;re following all the additional guidelines necessary.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>WEC Fiscal Staff will email you a copy of report when ready to approve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You do NOT need to wait for the request to be approved to start booking your travel (unless it is conference travel).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="booking-travel">Booking Travel&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With few exeptions, you must book all UF-related travel through UFGO&amp;rsquo;s booking agent.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Log into UFGO (concursolutions.com).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ensure you already have your profile (top right) set up with your contact info, P Card info, any loyalty programs you are a part of (airline, hotel, car rental), and your travel preferences.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Go to Travel (in the top menu bar).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Under TRIP SEARCH in the left pane, ensure you have selected &amp;lsquo;Business Travel&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Booking for myself&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Book flights, hotel and/or rental car all on the same itinerary.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Under Method of Payment, choose AirCard for flights, Pcard for everything else.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="ter">TER&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Once all your travel is completed and you have all your receipts ready to upload, fill out the &lt;a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=-KBNDTFKdk2s5gpiMx4bhGicOwDMKeFOrgQpJC5WLa1UNVpHSk4wN1pHWktOTzBSWVkzSDhFTVdRMCQlQCN0PWcu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TRAVEL EXPENSE REPORT / OUT OF POCKET REIMBURSEMENT FORM&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Go to Expense (in the top menu bar).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Current reports will be shown in the REPORT LIBRARY. Choose the name matching your notification email.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Check everything carefully and make sure everything is entered correctly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If everything is correct, click Submit Report.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="conference-travel">Conference Travel&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The PCard may be used to pay registration fees for conferences, conventions, or seminars. This includes those where the registration fee includes meals or social events. Registration reciepts must be itemized so UF can determine whether meals/social events/lodging are included in the fee or can be charged separately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Optional events, those with separate fees, cannot be paid via PCard. Optional events must be paid for by the traveler.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Travel Requests, required for all travel relating to conferences/conventions, must be done BEFORE making charges. The Travel Request number must be written on receipts and other supporting payment documentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="personal-travel-before-or-after-uf-related-travel">Personal Travel Before or After UF-related Travel&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You are welcome to add some personal travel to a UF-related work trip. You will just need to submit the information in your TA and TER. During your entire period of travel, you will need to designate each day as a &amp;lsquo;work&amp;rsquo; day or &amp;rsquo;non-work&amp;rsquo; day. When booking in UFGO, document the itinerary and price for what you would have booked if personal travel were not included, and include this as an attachment in your TER.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>University of Florida Benefits</title><link>http://localhost:1313/docs/uf-bureaucracy/benefits/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/uf-bureaucracy/benefits/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="postdocs">Postdocs&lt;/h2>

&lt;h2 id="committee">Committee&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A WEC committee needs to have 5 members total, with 2 members from WEC and 1 member from a non-WEC department. You should have a committee by the end of your second semester.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="qualifying-exams">Qualifying Exams&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You have to take quals by the end of your third semester. There&amp;rsquo;s a written part (from each committee member, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a set of questions you have to answer in a day) and then an oral part (could be related to written part, happens a couple weeks after written part). As soon as your quals are scheduled (probably a couple of months in advance), you should email each committee member individually to ask what topics they would like you to brush up on. They might give you a list of specific papers to read, or a general topic like &amp;ldquo;study metacommunities,&amp;rdquo; or they might not tell you to study anything in particular at all. A week or two before your quals, email each committee member again to remind them of the dates of your quals, remind them what they told you to study, and ask if they have anything to add. Each committee member gives you a written exam with rules set by that member, so it may be open- or closed-book (i.e. are you allowed to look stuff up), and a time limit (i.e. 8 hours). Generally the committee will send their exams to your adviser who will dispense them to you at the beginning of each day (or whenever you choose to have them dispensed). In between the written exams and the oral exam you may or may not get any feedback from your committee on how you did. In the oral exam, your committee may ask you to clarify or expand on your answers from the written exam.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="coursework">Coursework&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>See &amp;ldquo;Summary of PhD Degree Credit Requirements&amp;rdquo; section in the WEC Graduate Student Handbook [here] (&lt;a href="http://www.wec.ufl.edu/grad/October%202014%20WEC%20Grad%20Handbook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.wec.ufl.edu/grad/October%202014%20WEC%20Grad%20Handbook.pdf&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Clarifications on this section:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>None of the upper credit limits are actually limits on the number of credits that count towards the degree except for Supervised Teaching. For example, you can, and should, take more than 15 Doctoral Dissertation Research credits between quals and defense.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>For Supervised Teaching (WIS 6940), you can take as many of these credits as you want while TAing/teaching, but only 5 credits will count towards your PhD limit.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You need 90 credits to get a PhD, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually matter where those credits come from. You don&amp;rsquo;t need 30 credits from a master&amp;rsquo;s, for example. The list in this section of the Handbook is just one possible way to divvy up credits.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Many things can be petitioned, just make sure your committee is on board with this. Your advisor creates the petition, with the support of your committee members, and then gives it to the graduate coordinator for approval.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Credits that are transferred to UF initially only count towards total number of credits for PhD, and then your committee decides what the content of those transfer credits count towards, such as if they fulfill areas of emphasis reqs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You do have to take 12 credits with either a WIS or ALS prefix, though special topics (WIS 6905) can count towards those so it should be easy to fulfill.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Speaking of Special Topics (WIS 6905), the intention of this type of credit is for &amp;ldquo;independent teaching&amp;rdquo;. So, if you find that you&amp;rsquo;re spending substantial time teaching yourself something, you can get that registered as Special Topics. Then your advisor, or whoever is overseeing your Special Topics, just has to give you a grade for your work at the end. You can only take 5 credits of this type per semester, but can take many more than that throughout your PhD (see first point).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Apparently if you take enough credits in a particular area, it is pretty easy to get a non-thesis master&amp;rsquo;s for that work, and this often happens accidentally.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The other Special Topics are WIS 6934, and these are more formal classes taught by whoever that are oftentimes one-off. You can also count more than 10 of these credits towards your PhD (see first point).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The general rule is that only UF employees can drive UF vehicals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there are several ways to override this default:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Registered volunteers can drive UF vehicles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Individuals contracted through UF can drive UF vehicles if the contract explicitly states that the contracting organization is responsible for providing insurance related to operating the vehicles.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>UF has a system for purchasing supplementary insurance for individual vehicles to allow them to be driven by specific identified individuals who are not employees.&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="investigate-the-lab">Investigate the lab&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Talk to people at different career stages who have worked in that lab (current and former students/postdocs). Current students can give you insights into what things are like now, but may feel inhibited to speak freely since their careers depend in part on their current supervisor. Former students can be more uninhibited, but may lack understanding of the current state in the lab (depending on how long ago they finished). Ask the same questions of many people and then think about those answers. Are the answers generally consistent? Are there differences in responses? Are there patterns in those differences in responses (i.e. differences between students and postdocs? Men and women? People from marginalized groups?)? Are people enthusiastic when they respond or meh? For example: &amp;ldquo;I loved working for them!&amp;rdquo; provides clear positive information. &amp;ldquo;Yeah, it was fine&amp;rdquo; may indicate the person is uncomfortable talking about their experience. One person responding negatively is not necessarily a bad sign (no one is capable of providing a universally great experience for everyone), but a pattern is not good and requires some thought about what is going on and what it may mean for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Working environment questions for other lab members:
&amp;ldquo;How has [adviser] changed since you first began working with them?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Is there anything you&amp;rsquo;ve been hoping [adviser] would have changed by now, but hasn&amp;rsquo;t?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Career Paths</title><link>http://localhost:1313/docs/career-guidance/career-paths/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/career-guidance/career-paths/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="data-analystscientist">Data Analyst/Scientist&lt;/h2>

&lt;h2 id="faculty---extension-specialist">Faculty - Extension Specialist&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Summary:&lt;/strong> Land-grant universities in the U.S. have an outreach mission mandated by the federal government that is referred to as extension. The goal of extension is to communicate research products to the end-users. This mandate covers the general areas of agriculture, home and family, the environment, and community economic development. At a land-grant university there are special faculty who serve at the interface between research and outreach. These faculty often have part of their appointment dedicated to outreach and part to conducting research. Research is typically focused on an applied need in the state. Outreach activities may take a variety of roles from consulting with state agencies, running workshops to train state agents and/or the public in resources or tools, creating outreach material through websites or pamphlets, giving public talks to local organizations. There are a number of faculty in WEC with extension appointments (e.g., Mark Hostetler, Elizabeth Pienaar, Mathieu Basile).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Core skills:&lt;/strong> oral and written communication to broad audiences, project management, research-related skills.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Summary:&lt;/strong> Research scientists is a general descriptor for individuals employed to conduct specific research tasks and are employed in government,NGOs, and consulting. Individuals in these types of jobs are employed to design and conduct research that meets specific needs of that organization (e.g., provide analysis on management effectiveness, evaluate and recommend monitoring designs, determine potential environmental impacts or assess recovery). These jobs often also have an element of project management (managing the budget allocated for those research activities, management of field technicians, coordination with other units or agencies). Government scientist positions (at state and federal levels) often involve course requirements to qualify, which depend upon the title of the position (i.e. a Field Botanist would require a certain number of credits in plant-focused courses).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Core skills:&lt;/strong> research-related skills (depending upon the type of position - field ecology, data analyst, statistician), oral and written communication to broad audiences, basic project management.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Summary:&lt;/strong> Project managers oversee the planning and execution of projects. The difference between a project manager and a research scientist is that the project manager is often not involved in the execution of the project itself, but in managing and facilitating the ability of others to execute on the project. Project managers are employed in government, NGOs, and industry. They may manage a single lab, an institute/center, or extensive programs within large organizations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Core skills:&lt;/strong> personnel management skills, project management, administrative skills (procurement, hiring, budgets), oral and written communication to broad audiences.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Summary:&lt;/strong> Statisticians are involved in data manipulation, visualization, analysis, and interpretation. They work in a broad variety of environments including government, NGOs, industry, and academia. Similar to Data Analyst/Scientist but typically with greater emphasis on the statistical analysis component of the job.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Core skills:&lt;/strong> statistics/machine learning, data manipulation and visualization in high level languages (primarily R and Python), oral and written communication of results to broad audiences, and the ability to collaborate with people with a broad range of technical backgrounds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Things to do:&lt;/strong> 1) Learn R/Python, git/GitHub, statistics/machine learning, and Rmarkdown/Jupyter/Shiny; 2) Build website showing off these skills; 3) Start a statistics/data analysis related blog.&lt;/li>

You&amp;rsquo;re at the stage where you&amp;rsquo;re being interviewed remotely (e.g. skype, zoom, phone) or in-person. Here is some info on preparing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="interview-format">Interview Format&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First, note that many places do interviews differently, so it helps to read up a bit on the format/structure of the interview process. Below are some resources relevant to academic interviews:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://www.asha.org/academic/career-ladder/chap3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewing (in-person)&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://career.ucsf.edu/grad-students-postdocs/career-planning/academic-jobs/interviewing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewing (in-person)&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://thewayofimprovement.com/2017/07/10/how-to-interview-at-a-teaching-college" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewing (teaching college oriented)&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://xykademiqz.com/2016/12/22/skyping-your-way-into-or-out-of-a-faculty-job/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewing (skype)&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="responding-to-questions">Responding to Questions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The format of the interview can make it challenging to give the best impression of yourself. Usually, a group of people will ask you questions, and give you time/space to give a freeform response without a back-and-forth that would usually occur in a conversation designed to reach a consensus on a topic. (One supposes this helps to keep the process fair to each applicant, and enable responses to be comparable.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This means that many questions are of some form of &amp;ldquo;Tell us about your qualifications in X&amp;rdquo;. While it is natural to respond by describing your qualifications in X (and you should certainly do so!), you can turn a good response into a great response by further offering your opinion/thoughts about your experience in X. This helps demonstrate that you have thought about what worked and what didn&amp;rsquo;t, with potential for growing in the new position. (Instead of only being able to give a correct/expected answer of &amp;ldquo;Yes, I do have experience in X.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, for &amp;ldquo;tell us about your qualifications in teaching&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>do talk about your experience in teaching&lt;/li>
&lt;li>do talk about your training in pedagogy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>do talk about specific things you do in teaching and why (e.g. using formative assessments, because XYZ); perhaps also things you don&amp;rsquo;t do, and why not&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>This can be a challenging mindset to get into!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It can help to practice, on your own or with colleagues. The above links have some sample questions you can work from.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="asking-questions-of-your-own">Asking questions of your own&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In many cases, you&amp;rsquo;ll have some time to ask questions of your own. You can demonstrate interest by asking about aspects of the position that are unclear, or about the interview process (e.g. &amp;ldquo;when will I hear back about the next step&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Accessing the T-drive</title><link>http://localhost:1313/docs/computers-and-programming/t-drive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/computers-and-programming/t-drive/</guid><description>&lt;ul>

&lt;p>Assuming you&amp;rsquo;re running Ubuntu. Install the cifs-utils package, create a folder called /media/T for a mount point, then run the mount command, replacing &lt;code>&amp;lt;your-ufid&amp;gt;&lt;/code> with your ufid (the same one used for email).

These projects can give you a chance to establish your independence and learn to collaborate in a non-student-advisor scenario. Many weecologists do at least one project that doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve their advisor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a few limitations to be aware of when doing one of these projects:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>These should be projects where you don&amp;rsquo;t need a lot of mentoring and research guidance from your advisor. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that we won&amp;rsquo;t talk to you about it, but needing regular guidance on either the scientific or collaborative aspects of a project is a sign that you should reconsider whether or not your advisor should be formally involved.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Staff time and lab resources are paid for by grants. By law, there are restrictions on how grant funded time and resources can be used, and your advisor is legally responsible for certifying that these requirements are met. There are also lots of core projects that require staff time and resources and the need for these has to be balanced even in the absence of grant restrictions. On projects your advisor is involved in it is easy for them to keep track what is being done and make sure that it meets both grant requirements and needs of the lab, but this is harder for projects that they are not involved in. Therefore, before using lab resources (e.g., the HiPerGator), or asking staff to spend time on a project, it is important for you to check with your advisor first to make sure that the project is within scope for existing grants and that demands on staff time are appropriately balanced.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One of the things that your advisor does is keep track of related projects in the group and manage any overlap that occurs. In projects not involving them it is your responsibility to be aware of other related projects in the lab and manage potential overlap with your labmates.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></description></item><item><title>Authorship</title><link>http://localhost:1313/docs/publishing/authorship/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/publishing/authorship/</guid><description>&lt;p>[In Progress]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Trying to figure out who should be an author on a project - especially one developed in a group context - can be complicated. How much involvement warrants authorship credit is not clearly defined or nor is someone&amp;rsquo;s involvement easily quantified. The Weecology Philosophy is that it is better to be inclusive than exclusive. This is because it is easy to discount people&amp;rsquo;s contributions based on internalized biases. Some of these biases are things we have from our society. Some of these biases are because we have pre-conceived notions about how difficult/important/meaningful certain contributions are. If someone has done something for a project&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Career Advice from Others</title><link>http://localhost:1313/docs/career-guidance/career-advice-from-others/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/career-guidance/career-advice-from-others/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="intro">Intro&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A lot of info linked to is from a specific point of view, or has intrinsic biases, so general advice is to read broadly and take everything with a grain of salt. Usually, you can synthesize out what are the common generalities (everyone says it) vs. anecdotes.&lt;/p>

This code of conduct will be enforced as needed and applies to both the &lt;a href="http://ernestlab.weecology.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ernest Lab&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="http://whitelab.weecology.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">White Lab&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The philosophy of Weecology is to enable and support good science by creating a harassment and discrimination-free experience for everyone. Safe, inclusive, and harassment-free environments don&amp;rsquo;t just happen. They are created by the day-to-day interactions we all have with each other. Thus, it is the responsibility of all members of the lab to help create and maintain a safe, inclusive, harassment-free environment so that we may all benefit from it. Discrimination or harassment based on racial or ethnic background, citizenship status, religion (or lack thereof), political affiliation, gender identity/expression, sexual orientation, dis/ability status, appearance or body size will not be tolerated. &lt;strong>We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination by and/or of members of our community in any form.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are also committed to supporting and training a diverse scientific workforce. Current and former group members encompass a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds from the U.S. and other countries, members of the LGBTQ community, military veterans, people with chronic illnesses, and first-generation college students.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="general-guidelines">General Guidelines&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>All communication - online and in person - should be appropriate for a diverse audience, including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual or discriminatory language and imagery is not appropriate at any time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other contributors.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In general, assume that others are acting in good faith; for example, when they make suggestions or give criticism.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Please make an effort to make an inclusive environment for everyone. Give everyone a chance to talk and an opportunity to contribute.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be aware that your actions can be hurtful to others or contribute to a negative environment even if you had no intent of harm. Listen. Offer a genuine apology. Commit to learning and doing better.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>NOTE: lab members are expected to abide by these policies at all lab-related work events, such as conferences, workshops, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="enforcement-and-reporting-mechanisms">Enforcement and Reporting Mechanisms&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Participants asked to stop any harassing or discriminatory behavior are expected to comply immediately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any concerns about potential violations, please contact &lt;a href="mailto:morgan@weecology.org">Morgan&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="mailto:ethan@weecology.org">Ethan&lt;/a> immediately. If Ethan or Morgan is the cause of your concern (or you are uncomfortable talking to them directly for any reason), Kate Thibault (mailto:kthibault@battelleecology.org) is a good informal point of contact; she was one of the first weecologists, does not work for us or the University of Florida, and because of her career path does not rely on Ethan or Morgan in any way. She has agreed to mediate and discuss issues confidentially if desired. Concerns can also be directed to the &lt;a href="https://www.ombuds.ufl.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UFL Ombuds Office&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If inappropriate behavior persists, the issue will be escalated according to UFL policies; for more information please see the &lt;a href="http://hr.ufl.edu/manager-resources/recruitment-staffing/institutional-equity-diversity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UFL Institutional Equity &amp;amp; Diversity page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This document provides a guide to code structure and formatting across languages used within the Weecology projects. Links to language-specific guides are provided below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Generally, this guide follows the principles outlined
. In particular:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Write and style your code for human readers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Minimize the number of facts a reader is expected to hold at one time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use consistent, distinct, and meaningful names&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Employ consistent style and formatting&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="structure">Structure&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="modularize">Modularize&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Break code into chunks corresponding to contained tasks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whenever possible write code into functions, even if the function isn&amp;rsquo;t called repeatedly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="loops">Loops&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Loop should be used with repeated tasks unless you actually need the indices&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the language allows, use vectorized functions in place of loops to speed computation and reduce code volume&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="style">Style&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="naming">Naming&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Be concise and meaningful, but conveying meaning is more important than brevity
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Document abbreviations if they are not common or immediately intuitive&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Functions are verbs, variables are nouns&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use snake_case for variables and functions (e.g., &lt;code>portal_data&lt;/code>)
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Exceptions:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>established prefixes (e.g., &lt;code>n&lt;/code> in &lt;code>nobs&lt;/code> to indicate the number of observations)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>established suffixes (e.g., &lt;code>i&lt;/code> in &lt;code>obsi&lt;/code> to indicate the specific observation in a for loop)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use UpperCamelCase for class names for object oriented programming (primarily in Python)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do not use &lt;code>.&lt;/code> in names (
)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do not use single-letter names
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Exceptions:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>representing a term in an equation (e.g., &lt;code>y&lt;/code> in &lt;code>y = m * x + b&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>using an established name in a language (e.g., &lt;code>n&lt;/code> references the number of draws from a random variable in R)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Constants, and only constants, should be in all caps&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="white-space">White space&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>spaces after commas&lt;/li>
&lt;li>spaces around operators (unless inside the argument definitions in Python)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>no spaces around parentheses&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="line-length">Line length&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Lines &amp;lt;= 80 characters
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>But a few extra characters can be better than confusing contortions to make length&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parentheses/brackets/braces with breaks after commas are typically better than line break characters (but not always)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="indentation">Indentation&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Always indent to indicate that code is inside a function, loop, etc. (Python makes you do this. Thanks Python!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use spaces, not tabs (but it&amp;rsquo;s fine for you IDE to turn the tab key into spaces)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Follow language convention for number of spaces
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>R: 2&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Python: 4&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When breaking lines with parentheses (mostly in function calls/definitions) align with the leading character after the opening parenthesis
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">(stuff, things,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> more_things)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="references">References&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Magic numbers (numeric references to elements, columns, rows, etc.) should be avoided.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>References should be made by name or-in the case of loops-position.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="documentation">Documentation&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="in-line-commenting">In-line commenting&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="external-documentation">External documentation&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Use standard documentation comment styles
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>R:
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Python:
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>These can create formatted documentation, but they are useful visual indicators even if you don&amp;rsquo;t do this&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="language-specific-style-guides">Language specific style guides&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Follow official language style guides (within reason). This helps make your code broadly readable and makes external contributions more likely.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Python:
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Julia:
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>R:
. This isn&amp;rsquo;t official, or broadly agreed on, but it serves as the base (or at least justification) for a lot of what we do&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

Therefore having processes to engage all authors and solicit feedback in ways that improve the project, support the collaborators, and minimize wasted time are important.
Instead of working on it a manuscript on our own until you have a full draft, actively engaging collaborators early and often can lead better papers with less pain, by ensureing that everyone is on board with
the underlying questions, methodological decisions, visualization and other aspects of the project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Collaborative writing guidelines&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="step-1">Step 1&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Check with your adviser and collaborators to see if they agree that a set of analyses has reached that poitn that it should be written up as a paper.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="step-2">Step 2&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Define the knowledge gap that the paper will fill and the 2 or 3 key points that you want to communicate with the readers. This step helps engage collaborators in identifying why and where
your work is providing a better understanding/improvement of existing knowledge gaps. Write up the knowledge gap(s) and key points as bullet points and send them to your collaborators/adviser for feedback.
Lead a discussion to reach consensus on these ideas.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="step-3">Step 3&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Write a rough draft of a title and produce drafts of the key figures you envision including in the manuscript.
Send these to your collaborators/adviser and lead a discussion to reach consensus on the title and figures to be included.
This helps further define the paper and helps address any issues with analyses including identifying additional analyses that need to be conducted.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="step-4">Step 4&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Draft the Methods section and send it to your collaborators/adviser for feedback.
While everyone often thinks they know what has been done methodologically in a collaboration, writing it down can reveal differences in understanding about what exactly was done.
Writing and discussing this section first helps identify any analysis changes that need to be made &lt;em>before&lt;/em> a lot of time is invested in understanding the results (which could change if the analysis changes).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="step-5">Step 5&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Write an outline. Once everybody is on board, write an outline of the paper with each section of the paper including roughly one bullet points per paragraph.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Send these to your collaborators/adviser and lead a discussion to reach consensus on the outline.
At this point everyone will have had several opportunities to engage and come to consensus about what should be included in the paper.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="step-5b-optional">Step 5b (optional)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>At this point you can optionally expand each paragraph to sentence level bullet points, e.g., 3-4 words per bulletpoint.
This can be very helpful and save lots of time for folks still learning to write scientific papers, because the next step then involves only expanding each bullet point into a sentence.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="step-6">Step 6&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Write a &lt;em>rough&lt;/em> draft of the manuscript and send it to collaboratators for &amp;ldquo;big picture&amp;rdquo; feedback.
You can either do this a section at a time or draft the full manuscript and then send it to everyone.
Collaborators should be encouraged to read the draft and provide big picture suggestions identifying things that are missing, any additional work that needs to be added, and areas that need major improvement in communication.
They should not provide detailed editorial feedback at this stage.
Ideally this phase should be focused on the writing, but it also serves as a last chance to identify important analyses that are missing or need to be changed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="step-7">Step 7&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Incorporate collaborator feedback and revise the paper into a polished draft.
Send the manuscript to co-authors for feedback communicating what you expect from collaborators at this point is mainly editorial work and signoffs on the manuscript.
The goal of the previous steps is to ensure that no changes to the methods, figures, and questions needs to be made at this stage.
However, if something critical is identified at this stage that could influence the conclusions of the paper, then it is still important to address it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Computer Setup - Mac</title><link>http://localhost:1313/docs/computers-and-programming/computer-setup-mac/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/computers-and-programming/computer-setup-mac/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="terminal">Terminal&lt;/h2>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>Open up the Terminal, type in &amp;ldquo;git&amp;rdquo; and press enter.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>This should cause a pop-up window to appear. It will have several options; click on &amp;ldquo;Install&amp;rdquo; (not &amp;ldquo;Get Xcode&amp;rdquo;, see &amp;ldquo;Installing Xcode&amp;rdquo; for that).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When the install is finished, click &amp;ldquo;Done&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>To make sure this worked, type in &amp;ldquo;git&amp;rdquo; in the Terminal and press enter. Some information will come up, including a list of common commands.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;h3 id="configuring-git">Configuring Git&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s some basic info on Git setup from &lt;a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/#installing-git" target="_blank" rel="noopener">software carpentry&lt;/a>. If you are also setting up a GitHub account, be sure to use the same email address, so that when you use Git on your computer and &lt;em>push&lt;/em> the changes to GitHub, it identifies you correctly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On a mac, browsing folders in finder also tends to generate &lt;code>.DS_Store&lt;/code> files. You generally don&amp;rsquo;t want to include those in your repositories, so here are &lt;a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blogs/jeff-geerling/stop-letting-dsstore-slow-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some instructions&lt;/a> to ignore such files globally.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="installing-xcode">Installing Xcode&lt;/h3>
&lt;h3 id="github">GitHub&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Create a GitHub account by going to &lt;a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a service that allows you to store your code, project management materials, etc., online. It allows for other people to look at your work (if the repo is public). It also saves all the versions of your code as you change it, which is referred to as version control. This eliminates the need for creating multiple copies of code as you change it (e.g., folder with files called &amp;ldquo;data_analysis&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;data_analysis_3&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;data_analysis_45&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;data_analysis_final&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;data_analysis_final_really&amp;rdquo;) and you can use the online GitHub interface to easily look back at previous versions of your code and see what was changed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="repositories">Repositories&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A repository is where you put all of the materials related to single project. One repository per project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Creating a GitHub repository:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Open up a browser, go to the GitHub website, and sign into your GitHub account. Navigate to your profile page.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Click on the &amp;ldquo;Repositories&amp;rdquo; tab in the top middle of the page.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In the upper right hand corner, click on the green &amp;ldquo;New&amp;rdquo; button.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In this page, name the repo, preferably something short and succinct that uniquely describes the project. Also, there should be no spaces in repository names. If the name consists of multiple words, separate them by an underscore, dash, or camel case, e.g., mammal_community_dynamics, mammal-community-dynamics, MammalCommunityDynamics.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Select if the repo will be public or private. Keep in mind that you have a limited number of private repos for free, so most of your repos will likely be public. Having your research publicly available also makes for better science.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Check &amp;ldquo;Initialize this repository with a README&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Leave both &amp;ldquo;Add .gitignore&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Add a license&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;None&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Click green &amp;ldquo;Create repository&amp;rdquo; button. You&amp;rsquo;ve created your new repository, congrats!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Cloning GitHub repository:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The repository that was created above is the remote repository. This can be accessed from any computer using the browser. You also need to create a copy of the remote repository called the local repository. This copy of the repo can only be accessed from the computer it is created on. You will do work (e.g., changing code) on the local repo.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In the browser, navigate to the main page of the repository you want to clone.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In the right-hand column near the bottom, there is a bar containing a URL. There are two possible options for this URL, either HTTPS or SSH. You can switch between these two by clicking on the relevant blue hyperlinked acronym below the URL.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Click on the HTTPS blue hyperlinked word. Either HTTPS or SSH can be used, but it is easier to start with HTTPS. The difference between these is how they link the local repo to the remote, but that difference is not important right now.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Copy the HTTPS URL.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Open up the Terminal and navigate to the location on your computer where you want the local repo to be located. You can navigate around using the commands &amp;ldquo;ls&amp;rdquo; (this displays all the folders and files in the current directory) and &amp;ldquo;cd&amp;rdquo;. This latter command changes the directory, so you will type in the path for the directory you want to go to. For example, if I want to put the repo in the folder Projects, which is within the folder Documents, I would type the following into the Terminal: &amp;ldquo;cd Documents/Projects&amp;rdquo;. Then hit enter.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Once you&amp;rsquo;re in the directory where you want the repo to be located, type in the command &amp;ldquo;git clone&amp;rdquo;, a space, and then paste in the HTTPS URL.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Hit enter. This should create a new folder in the chosen directory that has the same name as the remote repo. This is your local repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Adding files and commits to local repository:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An important aspect of git/GitHub is version control. As you change scripts, you can use git to save all the different versions of scripts and then use GitHub later on to easily look at each of these versions. Then, if you mess up your code or don&amp;rsquo;t like the direction it&amp;rsquo;s heading in, you can access and use a previous version of your script very easily.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The way that you save these versions using git is by doing something called a commit. Each commit represents a different version of a script. Because you choose when to do a commit, you get to choose how different all of the versions of the script are. You should definitely make a commit for every major change in the code that you make, but you can never commit too often. When in doubt, commit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another important, and confusing, step in this process is adding the script. Before you can commit the newest version of a script, you have to add that script to the stage. This means that if you&amp;rsquo;ve changed several of the scripts within one local repository, you can add all of these scripts to the stage and commit them together, or you can add one script to the stage and commit it at a time.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Create a new script (in Python, R, or whatever language) and save the script in the folder for the local repository you&amp;rsquo;ve just created. Similar to the names of repositories, there should be no spaces in script names. See the fourth bullet point in the &amp;ldquo;Creating a GitHub Repository&amp;rdquo; section for naming conventions.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If you are not already there, open up the Terminal and navigate to the local repository folder using the &amp;ldquo;cd&amp;rdquo; command.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>To add the script, type in &amp;ldquo;git add &amp;quot; and then the name of the script, and then hit enter. (There should be a space between the add command and the script name). The script is now on the stage. Optional: You can repeat this multiple times in a row with different script names if you&amp;rsquo;re adding multiple scripts to the stage at the same time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>To make sure that the script has been added, type in &amp;ldquo;git status&amp;rdquo; and hit Enter. This will bring up information about the repo that you are currently looking at. If you&amp;rsquo;ve correctly added the script, under the &amp;ldquo;Changes to be committed:&amp;rdquo; header, there should be an indented bit of text that will be formatted as &amp;ldquo;modified: &amp;quot; and the name of the script you&amp;rsquo;ve added.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Now you want to commit this version of the script. In the Terminal, type in &amp;ldquo;git commit -m &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>message&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo; and hit enter. The &lt;em>message&lt;/em> is where you will insert a succinct, informative description of what changed between the last version and this newest version of the script. Writing good commit messages is a bit of an art, but there is some information [here] (&lt;a href="http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/&lt;/a>) on good commit messages.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You can use git status again to check that the commit worked. Type in &amp;ldquo;git status&amp;rdquo; and hit Enter. Now the entire &amp;ldquo;Changes to be committed:&amp;rdquo; section should be gone, because there should no longer be any changes that haven&amp;rsquo;t been committed in this repo.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You can look at this commit, and all previous commits, by typing in &amp;ldquo;git log&amp;rdquo; and hitting Enter. This will bring up a list of the commits, with the most recent commit at the top. The information about each commit includes the author, date, and message of the commit. At the top of each commit, there is a long string of letters and numbers. This is the hash, or unique identifier, for each commit.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You will do this add and commit workflow (steps 2-7) each time you make a substantial change to this script, or when you want to add another script.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Pushing and pulling:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The goal of this wiki is to document the steps to create a Orthomosaic from a set of UAV raw images.
This relates to the everglades project with both Inspire Quadcopter and Wingtra Drones, but can serve as a general guide for the steps to create a georeferenced image.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This tutorial uses Agisoft Metashape Pro. Future work needs to determine whether the standard version will suffice.

You have an offer. Now what?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="scope-of-negotiations">Scope of negotiations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Things you can (potentially) negotiate:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Salary&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Startup (the money they give you to start your group)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Teaching release&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lab/office space&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Partner accommodations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Moving expenses&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Depending on the type of institution the importance and possibility of negotiating different things will vary.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="salary-negotiations">Salary negotiations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We recommend taking a “data driven” approach to salary negotiation.
Start by looking up the current state of salaries for your position at that institution and their peer institutions.
You can find this information for faculty positions in a number of databases:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://data.aaup.org/ft-faculty-salaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Full-Time Faculty Avg. Salary, by Academic Rank | AAUP Data&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.chronicle.com/package/faculty-pay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Faculty Pay | Chronical for Higher Education&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/AAUP-2023-SurveyAppendices.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/AAUP-2023-SurveyAppendices.pdf&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Public institutions (like UF) will often have individuals’ salary information publicly available somewhere.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Folks sometimes self-disclose on the EcoEvoJobs Google Doc or on social media.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If the initial offered salary is lower than one or more of the numbers you&amp;rsquo;re finding you can ask for a higher salary in the context of that data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This approach is more comfortable for many folks (you&amp;rsquo;re not being greedy or full of yourself, just asking to be paid appropriately for the position).
It can also be more convincing to an institution because: 1) it&amp;rsquo;s hard to argue with internal salary discrepancies; 2) colleges/universities tend to be quite competitive with their peers; and 3) it can give the person you are negotiating with (often a department head) something to take to their boss (typically a dean) to ask them to provide more money for the position.
It also has the potential to help reduce bias.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="partner-negotiations">Partner negotiations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This varies greatly institution to institution, and your strategy will depend on your priorities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some general thoughts:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Common approaches to dual career accommodation include
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A second tenure-track (or tenured if you&amp;rsquo;re senior) faculty position&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A second faculty position that is short-term or soft-money and not tenure-track&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A non-faculty job&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Support/prioritize partners in hiring for jobs at the institution (while still requiring them to apply and be accepted)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Start by figuring out what your ideal outcome is and what you&amp;rsquo;d be willing to settle for
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Institutions should try to provide permanent solutions when hiring, but many will not&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As a result one common strategy is for the second person to take a temporary/suboptimal job for both partners to stay on the job market.
A competing offer (or sometimes just an interview) can then be used to leverage an more permanent solution from either your current institution or the one making you an offer.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Search for institution policies for dual career accommodation and if you can&amp;rsquo;t find them ask to see the policy if it exists
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The person you are directly negotiating with will not necessarily know about these policies, so it’s worth doing research and asking around.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Look for dual-career couples at the institution to talk to and the culture and policies around these topics&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="strategies-for-engaging-with-institutions">Strategies for engaging with institutions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Presenting options for multiple acceptable solutions that reflect trade offs can may be more likely to elicit problem-solving than specifying a single required outcome.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Get the perspective of folks with experience with peer institutions to gauge what you can reasonably expect. For example, very small SLACs may be less flexible and more compressed in their timelines, smaller state research universities may have smaller startup packages, etc. Talking to someone with experience at the type of institution your negotiating with can help you make realistic asks that are more likely to be provided.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Getting an inside perspective can be really helpful during negotiation, so if you met someone during your interview who offered to talk more or who you think might be open to it we recommend reaching out. The institutions may not &lt;em>want&lt;/em> you to talk to faculty other than the person you are negotiating with. This helps the institution by limiting your access to information. We recommend reaching out anyway.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Get as much of what you negotiate in writing as possible. Ideally this is in your offer letter (the closest thing you&amp;rsquo;ll get to a contract), but the institution may not be willing to do this. If try to get it in an email and then save that email (you&amp;rsquo;ll almost certainly need it later).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Negotiating over email is also useful for clarity, but sometimes the person negotiating will prefer to call you. This can be either to discuss inside information they don’t feel comfortable putting in an email (generally useful) because they think you&amp;rsquo;ll be more likely to agree to things over the phone (generally bad for you). Use your judgement, but often it is useful to follow-up phone calls with an email summarizing the call and confirming that everyone is on the same page about what was said and agreed on.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="other-things-to-pay-attention-to">Other things to pay attention to&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What is the teaching load and division of effort (what % teaching/research/service? What counts as service? How many course credit hours)?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ask for a teaching release in your first year. Depending on the institution type that could mean zero teaching or a reduced teaching load. This is pretty standard and necessary to give you the time to develop new classes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What space (lab space, office space) will you be provided. Are there funds for needed renovations/repairs? Do those costs come from your startup package or from a separate source.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is the process for evaluating/retaining faculty?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Is the institution financially stable: look up their financials and enrollment?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is the relationship between the institution and the state it is located in?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How happy do the faculty seem? Do they reach out to you after your interview?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="celebrate">Celebrate!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You have unlocked another level of navigating science! Enjoy the confetti and sense of invincibility.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>File Compression Notes</title><link>http://localhost:1313/docs/computers-and-programming/file-compression/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/computers-and-programming/file-compression/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="efficient-large-volume-decompression">Efficient large volume (de)compression&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When archiving large volumes of data using parallel and highly efficient algorithms can be useful.
We most commonly do this when archiving old projects on the HPC.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Linux (and our HPC) one of the easy ways to do this is with tar with zstd compression.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">tar --use-compress-program&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>zstd -cvf my_archive.tar.zst /path/to/archive
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>If you need to pass arguments to zstd they can be included in quotes, &lt;code>'zstd -v'&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To uncompress these archives:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">tar --use-compress-program&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>unzstd -xvf my_archive.tar.zst
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="ignoring-failed-reads-using-tar">Ignoring failed reads using tar&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When archiving files with tar the archive will fail if any file cannot be read by the account doing the archiving.
This is a common occurrence we archiving on the HPC and the files are often (but not always) hidden files that don&amp;rsquo;t need to be archived (but definitely check to make sure).
You can ignored these failed reads using the &lt;code>--ignore-failed-read&lt;/code> flag.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">tar --ignore-failed-read -cvf my_archive.tar.zst /path/to/archive
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="fixing-a-corrupted-zip-file">Fixing a corrupted zip file&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="using-zip">Using zip&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you try to open a zip file and it won&amp;rsquo;t unzip you can often fix it by rezipping the file (&lt;a href="https://superuser.com/questions/23290/terminal-tool-linux-for-repair-corrupted-zip-files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, try:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">zip -F corrupted.zip --out fixed.zip
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>If that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work try:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">zip -FF corrupted.zip --out fixed.zip
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>If you receive an error message like:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>zip error: Entry too big to split, read, or write (Poor compression resulted in unexpectedly large entry - try -fz)&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>then:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Make sure you have at least version 3.0 of &lt;code>zip&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Try adding &lt;code>-fz&lt;/code> to the command&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">zip -FF -fz corrupted.zip --out fixed.zip
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="using-p7zip">Using p7zip&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If none of this works try &lt;a href="https://7-zip.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">p7zip&lt;/a>, which can be installed using conda.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">conda create -n p7zip &lt;span class="nv">python&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>&lt;span class="m">3&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">conda activate p7zip
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">conda install -c bioconda p7zip
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This version is pretty out of date, but much less out of date than the one in the HiperGator module system.
The one in the HiperGator module is too old to solve the problems we&amp;rsquo;ve seen.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">7za x corrupted.zip
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Note that this will decompress into the current working directory not into &lt;code>./corrupted/&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="increasing-compression">Increasing compression&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There is a tradeoff between how long it takes to compress something and how much smaller gets.
When using &lt;code>zip&lt;/code> this is controlled by a numeric argument ranging from 1 (faster) to 9 (smaller).
So, if you&amp;rsquo;re archiving large objects try using &lt;code>zip -9&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have a bunch of already zipped files you can recompress them using the following bash loop:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="k">for&lt;/span> f in *.zip

&lt;p>One way to split a raster into pieces is to use the &lt;code>gdal_retile.py&lt;/code> Python script bundled with &lt;code>gdal&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following command will split &lt;code>myraster.tif&lt;/code> into 1500x1500 pixel rasters stored in &lt;code>outputdir&lt;/code>.
The first number is the width (in pixels) and the second is the height (in pixels) of each chunk.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">gdal_retile.py -ps &lt;span class="m">1500&lt;/span> &lt;span class="m">1500&lt;/span> -targetDir outputdir myraster.tif

&lt;h3 id="merging-rasters">Merging rasters&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One way to combine rasters is to use the &lt;code>gdal_merge.py&lt;/code> Python script bundled with &lt;code>gdal&lt;/code>.
We use LZW compression to reduce file sizes while ensuring that the resulting GeoTIFF can be used in all geospatial computing systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">gdal_merge.py -o output_file.tif input_file_1.tif input_file_2.tif input_file_3.tif

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>We use this two command approach instead of including compression in the merge command because gdal_merge.py doesn&amp;rsquo;t currently support BigTIFF creation correctly and many of our combined files are greater than the 4GB maximum for regular TIFFs.
&lt;code>PREDICTOR=2&lt;/code> produces more efficient compression in the presence of spatial autocorrelation, which we often have.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="virtually-combining-rasters">Virtually combining rasters&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Instead of actually merging the rasters you can create a virtual raster in a vrt file.
This file includes metadata on the positions of all of the rasters, which can be loaded into a GIS and viewed like a single raster.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">gdalbuildvrt virtual_combined_raster.vrt *.tif
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="removing-alpha-channels">Removing alpha channels&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>All of our code works with 3 band RGB rasters.
Occasionally we accidentally produce a raster that contains a 4th alpha channel.
This can be removed using GDAL.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First check to make sure the bands you want are the first three bands (they pretty much always are):&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">gdalinfo four_band_ortho.tif
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This should show something like the following info about channels:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">Band &lt;span class="m">1&lt;/span> &lt;span class="nv">Block&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>1501x1 &lt;span class="nv">Type&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>Byte, &lt;span class="nv">ColorInterp&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>Red
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">Band &lt;span class="m">2&lt;/span> &lt;span class="nv">Block&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>1501x1 &lt;span class="nv">Type&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>Byte, &lt;span class="nv">ColorInterp&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>Green

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The use &lt;code>gdal_translate.py&lt;/code> to just keep the first three bands:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">gdal_translate -b &lt;span class="m">1&lt;/span> -b &lt;span class="m">2&lt;/span> -b &lt;span class="m">3&lt;/span> four_band_ortho.tif three_band_ortho.tif

&lt;p>This is intended to be a default set of procedures for Weecologists to collaborate together using a Git/GitHub repository. For projects that are primarily being worked on by one person, this is probably unnecessary, but you may want to follow this anyway, so as to ingrain the workflow practices.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setup">Setup&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t done so already, please check out the onboarding
.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this guide, we presume that there is a single repo on GitHub and multiple users, who work on clones of that repo (on their local machines), and interface through GitHub.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="branching">Branching&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One way of thinking about git branches is that each branch represents a &amp;ldquo;lineage&amp;rdquo; of commits in a repo. By default, git repos have a &lt;code>master&lt;/code> branch, and adding commits to a new repo will create iterative versions of the project, all considered to be part of the &lt;code>master&lt;/code> branch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see the branches in your project using &lt;code>git branch&lt;/code> from the command line while in the folder with a git repo. This will list the branches in the repo:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">~/projects/portalr &amp;gt; git branch
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> biomass-function
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> hao-data-vignette
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">* master
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here, &lt;code>master&lt;/code> is marked with an asterisk (and possibly a different color) to indicate that it is the &amp;ldquo;active&amp;rdquo; branch. What this means is that new commits added to the repo will be derived from the end of the master branch and included as part of that branch.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="making-new-branches">Making New Branches&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We can create new branches by specifying a new branch name when using the &lt;code>git branch&lt;/code> command. This allows us to start a new &amp;ldquo;lineage&amp;rdquo; of commits from the current state of the repo.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">~/projects/portalr &amp;gt; git branch hao-test-branch
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>When we look at the branches, we now see:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">~/projects/portalr &amp;gt; git branch
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> biomass-function
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> hao-data-vignette
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> hao-test-branch
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">* master
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Notice that the active branch is still &amp;ldquo;master&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="switching-branches">Switching Branches&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To change the active branch, we use the &lt;code>git checkout&lt;/code> command:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">~/projects/portalr &amp;gt; git checkout hao-test-branch

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This is what it looks like when we run &lt;code>git branch&lt;/code> afterword:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">~/projects/portalr &amp;gt; git branch
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> biomass-function
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> hao-data-vignette
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">* hao-test-branch
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> master
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="pushing-to-github">Pushing to GitHub&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>After we have created a branch on our local clone of the repo, and made some commits, we might want to push those commits to GitHub. The first time we do so, however, we encounter an error:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">~/projects/portalr &amp;gt; git push

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> git push --set-upstream origin hao-test-branch
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The reason for this error is that the repo on GitHub does not have the branch &lt;code>hao-test-branch&lt;/code>, and commits have to be assigned to a branch. The suggested command does several things at once:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>create a branch called &lt;code>hao-test-branch&lt;/code> on the GitHub repo (which has the remote name &lt;code>origin&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>establish a link between the local branch called &lt;code>hao-test-branch&lt;/code> and the GitHub branch called &lt;code>hao-test-branch&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>push the local commits on &lt;code>hao-test-branch&lt;/code> to GitHub.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="pulling-from-github">Pulling from GitHub&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Suppose someone starts making an update and has pushed it to GitHub and wants your help before merging it into the master branch. How do you download that new branch?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, make sure we get all the information from the GitHub repo. This assumes that the GitHub repo is named as the &amp;ldquo;origin&amp;rdquo; remote (which is the default).&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">~/projects/portalr &amp;gt; git fetch origin

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>We want to create a local branch to mirror the &amp;ldquo;fix-test&amp;rdquo; branch:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">~/projects/portalr &amp;gt; git checkout -b fix-test origin/fix-test

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This has done several things: it retrieved the branch from GitHub to our local machine, set up tracking, and changed the current active branch. Now, if we make new commits to the local copy of the branch, we are able to push directly to that corresponding branch on GitHub.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pull-requests">Pull Requests&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The preference is to use GitHub to merge the updates on a new branch back into &lt;code>master&lt;/code>. We can do this by going to the &amp;ldquo;Pull requests&amp;rdquo; tab on the GitHub repo page and creating a &amp;ldquo;New pull request&amp;rdquo;.
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="flex justify-center ">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/docs/computers-and-programming/github_PR_tab.png" alt="" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suppose we want to merge from &lt;code>hao-test-branch&lt;/code> into &lt;code>master&lt;/code>. Then we select &lt;code>master&lt;/code> as the &amp;ldquo;base: &amp;quot; branch, and &lt;code>hao-test-branch&lt;/code> as the &amp;ldquo;compare: &amp;quot; branch. We can then write some comments for our new pull request before clicking on &amp;ldquo;Create new pull request&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>If the pull request fixes an issue, you can include keywords to
the issue when the pull request is merged.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="updating-pull-requests">Updating Pull Requests&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>At this point, other people can comment on the pull request itself in GitHub, if discussion regarding the changes needs to occur.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, assuming that the pull request has not yet been merged, further commits &lt;em>to that branch on GitHub&lt;/em> are automatically included with the pull request. Thus, if you later find a bug, you can make further changes and not have to submit a new pull request.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="merging-pull-requests">Merging Pull Requests&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In general, check with one of the repo maintainers about merging pull requests. This ensures that the &lt;code>master&lt;/code> branch doesn&amp;rsquo;t break (too often) and that everyone is informed about changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="summary-example">Summary Example&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Objective: I want to fix issue #1 in the
repo.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Download the repo from GitHub and onto my local machine. [&lt;code>git clone&lt;/code>]&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In my local machine, create a new branch (e.g. &lt;code>hao-add-biomass-function&lt;/code> &amp;lt;- prefacing the branch name with your name helps prevent branch name collisions. [&lt;code>git branch&lt;/code>]&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Switch to the new branch. [&lt;code>git checkout&lt;/code>]&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make the updates on my local machine. [&lt;code>git commit&lt;/code>]&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Push the updates to GitHub. [&lt;code>git push&lt;/code>]&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create the pull request on GitHub. [GitHub web interface]&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Merge the pull request on GitHub. [GitHub web interface]&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On my local machine, switch back to the master branch. [&lt;code>git branch&lt;/code>]&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Get the updates to the master branch [&lt;code>git pull&lt;/code>]
(optionally) Delete the branch on GitHub. [GitHub web interface, &amp;ldquo;Code&amp;rdquo; tab, &amp;ldquo;## branches&amp;rdquo;]

&lt;p>SNRE also requires a concentration. This encompasses 12 credit hours (at the PhD level, 6 for masters) of coursework. There is essentially a concentration for each department in the university, of which any can be chosen from. You then meet the requirement by taking 12 credits from that department. See the list
under &amp;ldquo;Standard Concentrations&amp;rdquo;. Alternatively you can choose a concentration which has a more varied selection of courses, see the above page under &amp;ldquo;Concentrations that require additional hours&amp;rdquo;. In either case, the credit hours that count toward a concentration also count for the other SNRE degree requirements.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="dissertation-submission">Dissertation Submission&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ll go thru several rounds of submission. The first must be by the 1st submission deadline. In this case the dissertation does &lt;em>not&lt;/em> have to be done, a single chapter will do. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly a formatting check. You&amp;rsquo;ll get feedback on this version which you&amp;rsquo;ll need to implement in your final version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After your defense and the appropriate forms are submitted by Karen you can submit the full, 100% approved by your committee, version of your dissertation. This first &amp;ldquo;full&amp;rdquo; submission must be done by the &amp;ldquo;Final Submission Deadline&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br>
Once your final dissertation is submitted, the editorial office will likely return it with formatting comments. You may go thru several rounds of this. You must address all their comments and have the dissertation &lt;em>accepted&lt;/em> by their office by the Final Approval/Clearance deadline. Once it has this final approval the dissertation aspect is finished.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Getting your dissertation formatting correct is several &lt;em>full&lt;/em> days worth of work at least. There are a slew of specific guidelines (worth noting is all the rules seem to make sure dissertations look the same as when typewriters were still used).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="main-considerations">Main considerations&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Your chapters must form one cohesive work. As this is rarely the case with dissertation chapters, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to make some writing adjustments to at least make them seem this way. Nobody in the editorial office will actually read yours in depth, so it&amp;rsquo;s not something you should invest a lot of time in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You must have an Introduction chapter and a Conclusion chapter. These do not need to be full length chapters, just a quick introduction and outlining the contents for the intro, and a wrap up for the conclusion. Shawn&amp;rsquo;s dissertation was composed of 3 already published manuscripts. The Introduction was the first 1-2 paragraphs from each paper&amp;rsquo;s Intro, while the conclusion was the last paragraph from each conclusion. They were modified slightly to make them read as one, and each was only 2 pages double spaced.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should utilize one of formatting templates here

If you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable in Latex, absolutely use that. There is a template on Overleaf.com titled &amp;ldquo;University of Florida Thesis Template&amp;rdquo;. You can see how it was used for a dissertation

&lt;h2 id="proquest-agreement">Proquest Agreement&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Along with the other paperwork you&amp;rsquo;ll fill out after defending, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a UF Publishing Agreement form. This specifies when you&amp;rsquo;d like UF to publish your dissertation and also which parts (either the full dissertation or just the abstract) UF will release to ProQuest, an online repository. Note that when you specify terms with Proquest you give them a non-exclusive licence to sell it, of which you&amp;rsquo;re granted a 10% royalty (but only if the total royalty payment is &amp;gt; $25). If you'd like Proquest to publish it "open-access" there is a $95 fee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s unclear exactly what Proquest provides as the UF Library will host a copy of your dissertation. If you want a bound copy of your dissertation Proquest does provide that (though several websites online do as well). Regardless you must fill in your details (contact info, dissertation title/abstract) on the Proquest site and submit it for the UF dissertation office to process it, even if in the UF Publishing Agreement your marked &amp;ldquo;dissertation only&amp;rdquo;. This must be done by the Final Clearance deadline.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="graduate-survey">Graduate Survey&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The graduate office requires you to fill out a graduate survey administered by NSF. It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lt; 10 minutes and is mostly about prior schooling and future plans. All responses in this are optional. Link to survey as of 2019:

&lt;p>Headings are the formal way of indicating different sections in a document.
This applies to everything from papers written in Word or Google Docs to webpages to software documentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Proper headings are more than just visual indicators of sections.
Using them provides:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Accessibility - screen readers know about headings and how to navigate with them. This lets folks using screen readers easily navigate the document. They can&amp;rsquo;t do this using bold or capitalized text.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Easier navigation for everyone - as with many improvements to access headings make everyone&amp;rsquo;s life easier. Using headings makes it possible to add tables of contents and these are often auto generate by systems like Word, Google Docs, pdfs, and websites (see that nice table on contents on the right side of this webpage? That&amp;rsquo;s thanks to the headings!). This makes it much easier for everyone to navigate jump around in the document. It also lets you link directly to individual sections (e.g., to ask a collaborate to comment on a subsection of the Methods or direct users to part of a webpage)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s easier to keep consistent heading formatting. Manually formatting headings means that if you decide to change the heading style in one place you have to manually change it in all of the other places. Using proper headings let&amp;rsquo;s you just change it once and it will show up everywhere.&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This guide gives a high level overview of how one goes about running R or python scripts on a high performance cluster (HPC). There are no coding examples here, and instead is designed to give someone a frame of reference for how to approach things, and where other more detailed tutorials fit in the larger picture. The expected user is someone who is comfortable doing analysis and writing scripts in R using RStudio, or python with various IDEs, and has no HPC experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is written for users of the &lt;a href="https://www.rc.ufl.edu/get-started/hipergator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UFL HiperGator&lt;/a> who code in R or python, but most information will apply to potential users for any HPC system and with any scripting language.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hpc-use-cases">HPC Use cases&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are two scenarios where you may want to run your analysis script on the HPC.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Your code takes a very long time to run&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
If your code is taking several hours, days or more to run on your personal computer then using an HPC is likely a good option for two reasons. One is the servers on an HPC have processors much faster than desktops and laptops, so with minimal changes your code will run significantly faster. Second is scripts on an HPC run independently of your personal computer, so you can shutdown your personal computer while the script on the HPC runs overnight or over the weekend. HPC systems can have a time limit of several weeks to a month for any single job.&lt;br>
If your script takes so long that it seems like it will never finish then an HPC can be especially beneficial. Say you do a test run on 1% of your data and it takes 2 days to run. Theoretically it will then take 200 days to run on your full dataset. In this case the benefit of the HPC is its parallel processing power.&lt;br>
By default R and python scripts run on a single processor. Most computers today have 4-8 processors though. And HPC servers have upwards of 64. If you spread the work out to multiple processors you can significantly decrease the amount of time it takes to run. For example: a script that takes 1 hour to run can potentially take 0.5 hours with 2 processors, or 15 minutes with 4 processors, or 7.5 minutes with 4 processors, and so on. There is computational overhead with parallel processing though so halving the time with a doubling of the number of processors is only a general rule. This is not a straightforward change to your code though and it will take time. See below about making scripts parallel and whether it’s even worth it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Your script fills up your computer&amp;rsquo;s memory and crashes when it runs.&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
When you have large datasets, such as raster files, it’s easy to use up all the memory and freeze your computer. As opposed to just waiting on long running scripts, in this case it makes it nearly impossible to do analysis. Just like HPC servers have powerful processors, they also have extremely large amounts of memory. Usually greater than 100GB. There is a good chance that they can handle whatever large datasets you throw at them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="should-i-bother-with-an-hpc">Should I bother with an HPC?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Your analysis and data can be of &lt;em>any&lt;/em> size. There is no minimum computational requirement to use an HPC. But understand there is a time cost involved with learning how to interact with an HPC and also optimizing your code so it runs most efficiently. Therefore, in some cases it isn’t worth it porting scripts to an HPC system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider an example where you have a script that takes 1 hour on your laptop, and you must run it once a month. It’s likely reasonable to just keep that workflow. But if a script takes 10 hours and you must run it once a week, then it’s worth considering doing it on an HPC. Especially since that will decrease the wear and tear on your laptop and free up that 10 hours for other uses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whether it’s worth it or not is unique to every situation. Also remember that once you learn all the HPC basics the first time, then that time cost isn&amp;rsquo;t needed for your next project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also consider that the two use cases described above might also be solvable by code optimization. If you can find a section of code which is slow and make it run fast enough to meet your needs, that is preferable over running the code on an HPC. There is no one solution to this, but a good starting point is Hadley Wickham’s Advanced R tutorial on &lt;a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Performance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Performance and Profiling&lt;/a>. This &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/K_90QGUPYCA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">45 minute video&lt;/a> also gives a great overview of profiling, optimization, parallel processing, and the implications in R.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-exactly-is-an-hpc">What exactly is an HPC?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A high performance cluster (HPC) is primarily two things.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It’s hundreds of individual servers in a data center. Each server is a computer just like your personal computer, but has more powerful components, and does not have a graphical user interface or even a monitor. You interact with the servers via the command line. If you’ve never used the command line consider it like the Rstudio console, or a python prompt, was your &lt;em>only&lt;/em> way to interact with a computer. More on this below.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It’s a system for scheduling, prioritizing, and running scripts from hundreds of users. This is how the hundreds of servers can be used as “one”. Access to them is controlled by scheduling programs which you interact with, which then put your scripts in a queue to be run when resources are free. Slurm is probably the most popular scheduler (and the one used on the HiperGator) but some HPC systems may use other ones like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_scheduler#Batch_queuing_for_HPC_clusters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PBS or MOAB&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="primary-steps-to-running-your-code-on-an-hpc">Primary Steps to running your code on an HPC.&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>You need an account&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
Signup for HiperGator HPC account &lt;a href="https://www.rc.ufl.edu/access/account-request/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>You must be able to login to the HPC via SSH and use the command line.&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
The command line can also be referred to as the “unix shell”. With this you use text commands (just like the RStudio console) to copy files, edit text files, interact with the scheduler, view job status, etc. See the &lt;a href="https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Getting_Started#Connecting_to_HiPerGator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hipergator Connection guide&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some unix tutorials:
- Scinet &lt;a href="https://geospatial.101workbook.org/IntroductionToCommandLine/Unix/unix-basics-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geospatial Unix Intro&lt;/a>
- Data Carpentry &lt;a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tutorial on the unix shell&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you work on a Mac computer you have a full unix shell available already called the Terminal. For Windows users there are several options available. See the bottom of the Setup page for the Data Carpentry unix shell tutorial.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>You must optimize your code to run on the HPC.&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
This is potentially the trickiest part. At a minimum your code must be able to run independently without any interaction from you. Do you have one large (or even several) analysis script where you highlight different parts to run in the correct order? Or to check output before moving on? That will not work on an HPC. A single R or python file (aka a script) must run from start to finish and write some results to a file to be able to be useful on the HPC.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For R, a good test for this is the Jobs tab in RStudio (next to Console and Terminal tabs. Not available on older versions of RStudio). This is &lt;em>very&lt;/em> analogous to running a script in an HPC environment. If your script can run as an RStudio Job &lt;em>without&lt;/em> copying the local environment or copying the job results anywhere (your script should write results to some file) then it should be able to run on the HPC.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For python a good test is being able to run the script via the command line (ie. &lt;code>python my_analysis.py&lt;/code>). If you are using an IDE (like spyder or pycharm) then running a full script from start to finish using the “Run” option should also be sufficient.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having a script run without any interaction does not necessarily mean it needs to have parallel processing. See Should I make my code run parallel? below.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>You have to get your code and data onto the HPC.&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
You’ll need to use special programs to transfer files (both data and scripts) from your local computer to the HPC. For windows this will be the WinScp program, which will have the same username and password as logging into the command line. For mac or linux users you can use the Terminal to transfer files via the command line using the scp command. Read more about the &lt;a href="https://scinet.usda.gov/guides/data/datatransfer#small-data-transfer-using-scp-and-rsync" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scp command here&lt;/a>. More on data transfer for HiperGator can be found here. Something you’ll see mentioned a lot is Globus, which is a useful (but not strictly required) tool when you need to transfer 100GB+ of data.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>You need to ensure you have the correct packages.&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Most HPC systems will have common packages installed and ready to use. If not you’ll have to install them yourself. If you do this then the latest versions will be installed on the HPC, so it’s good practice to make sure all packages on your personal computer are up to date to so they match (in RStudio use Tools-&amp;gt; Check for package updates, in python use conda or pip to update all package to the latest version).
For python packages for your projects you’ll want to use environments with either conda or python virtual environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you run into errors installing R or python packages you&amp;rsquo;ll likely need to contact HPC support for help, especially if the errors involve missing system libraries. If you successfully install your own packages they will only be available to you, and not to anyone else using the HPC.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also take note of the &lt;a href="https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Modules_Basic_Usage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">module&lt;/a> command on the HiperGator. This is used to load preloaded software, including R and python themselves. This is covered is most tutorials about batch scripts (see next section).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>You can now submit your scripts to the scheduler.&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Once your data and scripts are on the HPC system you can submit them to the scheduler to run. This involves defining “jobs” where you tell the scheduler what you need. Specifically: the location of your script, the resources needed (cpus and memory), the time needed to run your script, the location for putting script output and logs, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jobs are defined via batch scripts which have a line for each piece of information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>You might need to debug your script if it doesn’t run correctly.&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
It’s very common for scripts to not run the first time because they were written on a personal computer and things like directory paths and packages may be different. In this case it’s useful to debug your script on the HPC directly.
A good place to do this is an “interactive node” or “interactive session”. For these instead of submitting a job to the queue, you request a new unix shell where a small amount of resources are available. Here you can run your scripts via the Rscript or python command and see the output directly, and make adjustments as needed until it runs successfully.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>You can now get your results back.&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
This is the same process as putting scripts and data onto the HPC but in reverse.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="should-i-make-my-code-run-on-parallel-processes">Should I make my code run on parallel processes?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before you dive into making your script parallel, do a quick cost/benefit analysis. It may indeed take a full day or more to redo your code to take advantage of parallel processing, but the benefits could be extremely large. If your code already runs in a relatively short time, like a few hours on your laptop and less than an hour on the HPC without any modification, and you&amp;rsquo;re happy with that then making it parallel might not be worth it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you do not use parallel processing then your jobs will always request just a single processor. This is perfectly fine as there is no minimum requirement for using an HPC.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="make-your-scripts-use-parallel-processing">Make your scripts use parallel processing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>By default R and python run on a single processor. Most computers today have 4-8 processors. If you spread the work out to multiple processors you can significantly decrease the amount of time it takes to run.
For example: a script that takes 1 hour to run can potentially take 30 minutes with 2 processors, or 15 minutes with 4 processors. To make your scripts run across multiple processors, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to make some adjustments to your code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For R users, if your code uses lapply to run your main function to many items (e.g. fitting the same model to many species), you can swap it for mclapply from the parallel package without making any substantial changes. For more details and advanced uses, here are some short tutorials that go over this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Some notes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If your code already uses functions and for loops, it should be straightforward to make it parallel, unless each pass through the loop depends on the outcome from previous passes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On your own computer, never set the amount of processors used to the max available. This will take away all the processing power needed to run the operating system, browser, and other programs, and could potentially crash your computer. To test out parallel code on my computer I set the number of processors to use at 2 (out of 8 available). Then when the scripts are moved to the HPC I set the amount to something higher.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-about-distributed-computing">What about distributed computing?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The links and examples for parallel computing above show you how to utilize the multiple processors in a single system. In the case of the HPC this means up to (usually) 64-128 processors on a single server. But what if you still need more processing power? In this case it’s possible to write parallel code which takes advantages of the processors on &lt;em>numerous&lt;/em> individual servers. This is how one utilizes 100’s or even 1000’s of processors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Going from single system parallel processing to distributed computing with your script is possible but will likely take even more work on your part. For this you might come across tutorials using MPI technology. MPI (Message-Passing Interface) is the protocol for analysis scripts to communicate between servers in an HPC environment, thus enabling distributed computing. Packages to use MPI are available in all common languages such as R, python, julia, and matlab.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Newer packages are available which either deal with MPI in the background for you, or implement newer protocols. The R package &lt;a href="https://mllg.github.io/batchtools/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">batchtools&lt;/a> has many high end functions for distributed computing. The python package &lt;a href="https://docs.dask.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dask&lt;/a> is a state of the art package for distributed computing, and the accompanying &lt;a href="https://jobqueue.dask.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jobqueue&lt;/a> package integrates it with SLURM and other HPC schedulers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="other-considerations-and-important-points">Other considerations and important points&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Research Computing group has a &lt;a href="https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/UFRC_Help_and_Documentation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wiki on HiperGator usage&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some common tasks and scripts are outlind in the &lt;a href="http://localhost:1313/docs/computers-and-programming/hipergator-reference/">HiPerGator Reference Guide&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Login Node&lt;/strong>: When you sign into the HPC there is a single landing server which you’ll start on. It’s important to never run actual scripts on this initial server. It should be used to submit jobs, request development nodes or interactive sessions, or transfer data in or out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Partitions&lt;/strong>: HiperGator resources are divided into partitions, where each partition has a specific set of hardware and resource and tim**e limits. Whenever you request resources you’ll specify which partition you want to use. See the &lt;a href="https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Available_Node_Features" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partitions wiki page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Account limits&lt;/strong>: The resources you request (eg. number of processors and amount of memory) is limited by how many credits your group has purchased. The number of jobs which can be running concurrently is also determined by this. See more on the &lt;a href="https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Account_and_QOS_limits_under_SLURM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">account limits wiki page&lt;/a>. This is also referred to as QOS (quality of service), a term coined in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early internet days&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Processors/CPU/Cores/Sockets/Threads&lt;/strong>: Each of these things is technically different and has a distinct definition. For most users of an HPC system they can be thought of interchangeably though. When you request resources via a batch script, or other method, you’ll usually ask for multiple CPUs to implement parallel processing and leave it at that. Advanced users can read about different terminology &lt;a href="https://login.scg.stanford.edu/faqs/cores/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/mc_support.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>HiPerGator Reference</title><link>http://localhost:1313/docs/computers-and-programming/hipergator-reference/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/computers-and-programming/hipergator-reference/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="what-is-hipergator">What is HiperGator?&lt;/h2>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="gpu">GPU&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To test out work involving a GPU you need to explicitly request a development node associated with a GPU. For many GPU tasks you may want a meaningful amount of memory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In most cases you&amp;rsquo;ll use the default GPUs:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">srun --nodes&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>&lt;span class="m">1&lt;/span> --gpus&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>&lt;span class="m">1&lt;/span> --mem 20GB --cpus-per-task&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>&lt;span class="m">1&lt;/span> --pty -u bash -i
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>But if you need a lot of VRAM (&amp;gt;24 GB/GPU) you can use the B200 nodes:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">srun -p hpg-b200 --nodes&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>&lt;span class="m">1&lt;/span> --gpus&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>&lt;span class="m">1&lt;/span> --mem 50GB --cpus-per-task&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>&lt;span class="m">1&lt;/span> --pty -u bash -i
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>To increase the number of GPUs increase the value of &lt;code>--gpu&lt;/code>, but you typically shouldn&amp;rsquo;t need more than 2 for interactive work and then only if you&amp;rsquo;re setting up multi-GPU testing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To increase the number of CPUs increase the value for &lt;code>--cpus-per-task&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-do-i-know-if-its-running">How do I know if its running?&lt;/h2>

You want this to be &lt;code>R&lt;/code> for &amp;ldquo;running&amp;rdquo;, but it can spend a while as &lt;code>Q&lt;/code> (in the queue) before starting, especially if you request many cores. Sometimes (but not always) the output will explain why you&amp;rsquo;re still in the queue (e.g. QOSMEMLIMIT if you&amp;rsquo;re using too much memory).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-do-i-get-my-data-on-to-hipergator">How do I get my data on to HiperGator?&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Often, the easiest way to transfer files to the server is using &lt;code>git clone&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If your files aren&amp;rsquo;t in a git repository, you can use FTP or &lt;code>scp&lt;/code>. FTP has graphical user interfaces that allow you to drag and drop files to the server.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If you use &lt;code>scp&lt;/code>, the syntax for copying one file from your user folder on the server to your local folder is &lt;code>scp MY_USER_NAME@gator.hpc.ufl.edu:/home/MY_USER_NAME/PATH_TO_MY_FILE MY_LOCAL_FILENAME&lt;/code>. Note the space between the remote path and your local filename. If you want to send a file in the other direction, switch the order of the local file and the remote location. You can copy whole folders with the &lt;code>-r&lt;/code> flag.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If your files are large you should use Globus. See
&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>
&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="storage">Storage&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are a few locations to store files on the hipergator&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>/blue/ewhite/&lt;/code>&lt;br>
This is the primary space for storing large files, any large amounts of data generated by your programs should be pointed to this location.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>/orange/ewhite/&lt;/code>&lt;br>
This is another space to store large files. The total allocation here is much bigger than &lt;code>/blue&lt;/code>, but this storage space is slower than &lt;code>/blue&lt;/code>. If you have 100GB&amp;rsquo;s of data that you want to save, but are not currently using, &lt;code>/orange&lt;/code> is where they should go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>/home/your_username/&lt;/code>&lt;br>
Your home directory has 20GB storage space for your scripts, logs, etc. You should not be storing large amounts of data here.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="local-scratch-storage">Local scratch storage&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;code>$TMPDIR&lt;/code>&lt;br>
&lt;code>/blue&lt;/code> may be a bad place to store temporary cache files, especially if your program is generating 100&amp;rsquo;s of small (&amp;lt;1mb) files. An alternative is to use a temporary directory setup by SLURM every time you run a job. This can be referenced with the environment variable &lt;code>$TMPDIR&lt;/code> or &lt;code>SLURM_TMPDIR&lt;/code>. Read more about this here:
.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Below are a collection of best practices by past Weecology Users. These are not the only way to do things, just some useful tools that worked for us.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="r">R&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="installing-packages">Installing packages&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>HiPerGator has a lot of packages installed already, but you might need to install your own, or you might want an updated version of an existing package.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can tell R to prefer your personal library of R packages over the ones maintained for Hipergator by adding &lt;code>.libPaths(c(&amp;quot;/home/YOUR_USER_NAME/R_libs&amp;quot;, .libPaths()))&lt;/code> to your &lt;code>.Rprofile&lt;/code>. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have one yet, you can create a new file with that name and put it in your home directory (e.g. in &lt;code>/home/harris.d/.Rprofile&lt;/code>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The end result will look like this.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Once this is set up, you can install or update packages the usual way (e.g. with &lt;code>install.packages&lt;/code> or &lt;code>devtools::install_github&lt;/code>).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="re-writing-your-code-to-take-advantage-of-multiple-cores">Re-writing your code to take advantage of multiple cores.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>By default R runs on a single processor. Most computers today have 4-8 processors. If you spread the work out to multiple processors you can decrease the amount of time it takes to run by significantly. For example: a script that takes 1 hour to run can potentially take 0.5 hours with 2 processors, or 15 minutes with 4 processors. To make your scripts run across multiple processors, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to make some slight adjustments to your code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your code uses &lt;code>lapply&lt;/code> to run your main function to many items (e.g. fitting a model to each species), you can swap it for &lt;code>mclapply&lt;/code> from the &lt;code>parallel&lt;/code> package without making any substantial changes. For more details and advanced uses, here are 2 short tutorials that go over this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>
&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>
&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Some quick notes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If your code already uses functions and for loops, it should be very easy to make it parallel, unless each pass through the loop depends on the outcome from previous passes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On your own computer, never set the amount of processors used to the max available. This will take away all the processing power needed to run the operating system, browser, and other programs, and could potentially crash your computer. To test out parallel code on my computer I set the number of processors to use at 2 (out of 8 available).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="batchtools">Batchtools&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Recently, the R package batchtools has made simple parallel job submissions in R much easier. No more bash scripting, just submit a set of jobs by mapping a function to a list of inputs. Here is an example.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="support">Support&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hipergator staff are here to support you. Our grant money pays their salary. They are friendly and eager to help. When in doubt, just ask.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more information on (job submission scripts)[https://wiki.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Annotated_SLURM_Script]&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="priority">Priority&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The supercomputer is a shared resource, and the SLURM scheduler has to decide how to divvy it up. The method they use for deciding when it&amp;rsquo;s your turn to use a machine based on a metric called &amp;ldquo;FairShare.&amp;rdquo; You can see your FairShare number by typing &lt;code>sshare -U&lt;/code> in your hipergator terminal. A FairShare of 0.5 means you&amp;rsquo;ve been using exactly your share. Larger numbers mean you can use more, while smaller numbers mean you&amp;rsquo;re using more than your share and will be given lower priority.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your &amp;ldquo;usage&amp;rdquo; number is an exponentially-weighted moving average of the resources you&amp;rsquo;ve consumed, with a half-life of two weeks. So if you&amp;rsquo;ve &amp;ldquo;bursted&amp;rdquo; at 10x for a while, it might take a few weeks before you&amp;rsquo;re given decent priority again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A more comprehensive description of FairShare is available
.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="bursting">Bursting&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If your jobs will take less than 4 days, you can use &amp;ldquo;burst&amp;rdquo; mode, which provides &lt;em>ten times&lt;/em> as many cores and &lt;em>ten times&lt;/em> as much memory as the default mode. If you cannot burst, just remove the &lt;code>-b&lt;/code> from the line above about &lt;code>qos&lt;/code>. Note than if you are using burst your jobs will automatically be killed after 96 hours if they haven&amp;rsquo;t already finished.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="current-usage">Current usage&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To see the current usage by our group, as well as overall hipergator usage, use the command&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>slurmInfo -pu&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To see the total available resources use:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>sacctmgr show qos ewhite format=&amp;quot;Name%-16,GrpSubmit,MaxWall,GrpTres%-45&amp;quot;&lt;/code>&lt;br>
for the normal queue, and &lt;br>
&lt;code>sacctmgr show qos ewhite-b format=&amp;quot;Name%-16,GrpSubmit,MaxWall,GrpTres%-45&amp;quot;&lt;/code>&lt;br>
for the &amp;ldquo;burst&amp;rdquo; queue.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="partitions">Partitions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The HiperGator consists of hundreds of servers. These a split up into several &amp;ldquo;partitions&amp;rdquo; for various reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of the time you can just use the defaults, but there are a few species partitions available that you might been to request:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>hpg-b200&lt;/code> - This is the partition to use for GPU jobs with large VRAM needs (&amp;gt;24 GB/GPU). You need to have paid for GPU access, which our lab has.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>bigmem&lt;/code> - This partitions consists of several servers with up to 1TB of memory. This is useful if you need a &lt;em>lot&lt;/em> of memory but still want to keep a script on a single server.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>hpg2-dev&lt;/code> - These are several servers for development purposes. When you use &lt;code>srundev&lt;/code> the jobs get sent here.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="selecting-a-partition">Selecting a partition&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>By default you&amp;rsquo;ll run jobs on the &lt;code>hpg2-compute&lt;/code> partitions. If you want to change it, edit the &lt;code>--partition&lt;/code> line in your job script, or use the &lt;code>-p&lt;/code> command in &lt;code>srun&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with cron jobs read
.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="ssh-to-daemon">SSH to daemon&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Cron jobs on the HPC need to be setup on a special machine called &lt;code>daemon&lt;/code>.
You can ssh there from the HPC using &lt;code>ssh daemon&lt;/code>.
After that you can use the usual &lt;code>crontab -e&lt;/code> to setup your cron job.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="setting-path-for-cron-jobs">Setting PATH for cron jobs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For some reason the PATH isn&amp;rsquo;t properly set when running cron jobs, so you need to set it at the top of the crontab.
Add a line like this adding any additional paths you need (e.g., the location of your conda environments).&lt;/p>

Because of this, the ideal scenario is that you identify the need for bioinformatics collaboration &lt;strong>before&lt;/strong> your grant is submitted so that there will be an appropriate allocation of funding. If this is not the case, we will estimate our effort given the project&amp;rsquo;s needs and determine whether the project has sufficient funding available to support bioinformatics collaboration.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hurricane Preparedness</title><link>http://localhost:1313/docs/lab-policy-procedures/hurricane-preparedness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/lab-policy-procedures/hurricane-preparedness/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="sciencelab">Science/lab&lt;/h2>

On-site interviews give prospective weecologists the best feel for what we are about and what they might expect if they join our group. It also gives us a chance to see if our work/training environment is one that will suit the needs of the potential weecologist.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="interview-structure">Interview Structure&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A typical weecology interview is one day and structured around individual (or small group) meetings with the members of the lab (including remote members). The day starts with a breakfast meeting with Ethan and/or Morgan (depending on who the person will be working most closely with), with the discussion focused on logistical and management aspects of the group. This serves as an orientation. Who are we, how do we manage our people, what is the advisor/supervisor&amp;rsquo;s role, what flexibility is there in the position, what is the hope/expectation for what the person filling the position will do/experience. The interviewee then meets with the other people in the lab and Ethan and Morgan will provide funds for lab members to take the interviewee to lunch. They will have a second meeting with their primary advisor/supervisor which will focus on the specifics of the position (staff), general research discussion (students), or a combination of the two (postdocs). The day ends with dinner with Ethan and Morgan to allow the interviewee to ask any any additional questions that they have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This structure serves several purposes. It gives the interviewee repeated access to Ethan and Morgan, which helps develop rapport and a better sense of the applicant. It also provides them with dedicated time to focus on the environment they would be joining and the role they would be playing in that environment. The one-on-ones with lab members allow them to learn about the breadth of research, job goals, and experiences of people in the group to help them figure out if we would provide the type of environment they are looking for. It also allows us (weecology) to see how interviewees interact with people from a range of backgrounds and experience levels.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lab-member-roles">Lab Member Roles&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The role of lab members is to provide information to the interviewee about what life working in weecology is like and provide feedback to Morgan &amp;amp; Ethan about their interactions with, and perceptions of, the interviewees. Here are some things to think about while interacting with interviewees:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Give them your honest feedback on the pros and cons of the group, working with Ethan and Morgan, Gainesville, UF, etc. Everyone has their own personal tradeoff landscape and we want people to make an informed decision to join us.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One of the biggest issues we see in hiring at all levels (students, staff, faculty) is people making decisions based on whether they can see themselves hanging out with/being buddies with an interviewee. This is not an appropriate filter (we are hiring colleagues, not friends) and it is one of the primary ways that implicit bias can influence decision making and result in biased hiring.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>That said, how someone will interact professionally is important. We are a collaborative group with diverse interests and career goals. Things to look for:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Do they seem supportive of diverse career pathways or dismissive of particular career goals?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do they listen to you and respond in a professional manner or do they act like talking to you is a waste of time and say dismissive things about your research or other pursuits (not liking your favorite team/hobby is not the same as judging you negatively for having a hobby)?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do they seem like they would work well in a collaborative environment - listen and think about different perspectives and engage proactively in discussions with you?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do their research interests align well with the group/funding support?
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>People who have done well/been happy in our group are often those with more general research interests. For example, someone interested in using rodents to better understand general processes as opposed to someone primarily interested in understanding rodents or understanding the ecology of a particular place (e.g., SE Arizona). General interests help ensure that folks feel like a part of the lab even if no one else is working in their particular area.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Are they excited about science?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Are they interested in interdisciplinary research and a mix of field and computational approaches?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Are they comfortable with/excited about working in an open manner?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Is there something in your interactions with the individual that makes you think our group is a particularly good fit or that they might do well with us but struggle in other workplaces/lab environments that they are more likely to run into?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="lab-member-contributions">Lab Member contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In cases where the interviewee is visiting Gainesville for the interview, there are some additional contributions expected from lab members.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We like student and post doc interviewees to stay with a lab member during their visit, rather than in a hotel. This provides more opportunities for informal interaction with the interviewee. You do not need to have a fancy guest room to host, a couch/air mattress is fine.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rides to the airport.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lunches/dinners: Anyone (at a relevant stage for the interviewee) that has interacted with the lab in any way (classes, carpentries, visited Portal, etc) is welcome to join meals. They can provide an outside perspective of the lab, or even just what it&amp;rsquo;s like to be at UF in general.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Morgan and Ethan will cover all (reasonable) expenses related to hosting the interviewee (dinner/breakfast on travel days)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="feedback">Feedback&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are a variety of ways to provide feedback.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Lab meetings: Often Ethan and Morgan will call an ad hoc lab meeting or use the beginning of regular lab meeting to have discussions about the candidates. They may have some specific questions related to things they have been pondering about the interviewees, but there will also be time for general feedback as well. These events will generally happen once all the interviews have been conducted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Written Feedback: If you would rather provide feedback in a written format, DM via slack or email are both good options. Do NOT use one of the open channels to discuss candidates as anyone who joins the group may have access to that. You may either provide feedback after each candidate or once all the candidates have interviewed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Via Glenda or other staff member: If you have something you want to convey but for whatever reason do not want us to know who the information is coming from, you may provide feedback to a staff member you feel comfortable with and have them relay your thoughts to us (or slip a note under our door).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></description></item><item><title>Lab Meetings</title><link>http://localhost:1313/docs/lab-policy-procedures/lab-meetings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/lab-policy-procedures/lab-meetings/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="lab-meeting-purpose">Lab Meeting Purpose&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Lab meeting is designed to give Weecology members opportunities to gain and practice skills, obtain feedback, and interact with the broader research group.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lab-meeting-organization">Lab Meeting Organization&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To make lab meeting a positive and useful experience for everyone, we have defined a series of lab meeting types with associated guidelines on how the leader should prepare and what role the group should play during lab meeting. Each semester we will assess the overall needs of the group and assign lab meeting types to particular dates. Lab members can select and trade dates but, because we have a plan for the order of slots, lab meeting types should not be moved from their assigned dates without approval from Ethan and Morgan.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lab-meeting-types-alphabetical">Lab Meeting Types (Alphabetical)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A list of some possible lab meeting types including their purpose, format, the responsbilities of the person leading the lab meeting and the responsibilities of the group is listed below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is also &lt;a href="lab-meeting-flowchart.png">a flowchart&lt;/a> version to help you decide what format works best for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="lightening-talk-sessions">Lightening Talk Sessions&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Purpose: To communicate within the lab about current research projects to encourage interactions and collaborations related to shared interests.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Format: All or some subset of the lab will give 5-minute talk following &lt;a href="http://scottberkun.com/2009/how-to-give-a-great-ignite-talk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ignite talk style&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leader Responsibilities: Every speaker is expected to give a 5 minute talk (and no longer!) on one of their projects that abides by the ESA Inspire guidelines.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Group Duties: Enjoy and think about what projects have in common and what skills discussed in the talks might be useful for other projects in the lab.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="mini-lessons">Mini-Lessons&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Purpose: To promote skill and information transfer within the group and provide opportunities to gain teaching experience in-house.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Format: A 45 minute lesson on any topic of general interest to the group.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leader Responsibilities: Good teaching takes advance planning. Take time to think about the current knowledge levels within the group and design a lesson plan that will convey your information/skills effectively. Try to avoid unnecessary jargon as it often creates more barriers to learning than it helps overcome. Determine an appropriate amount of material for 45 minutes - it&amp;rsquo;s about how much people learn, not about how much you present, and less is often better. It is recommended that the leader practice their lesson privately before delivering it to the group. If the group needs to do any advanced preparation, make sure to communicate this well in advance (i.e. not the day of the lab meeting).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Group Duties: Ask questions if confused. This serves the dual purpose of helping group members learn (others are probably also confused) and helps the leader understand where there are issues with their lesson plan that can be improved in the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="talk-rehearsals">Talk Rehearsals&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Purpose: To get feedback on the organization, flow, and clarity of a talk that is going to be presented for a conference, job seminar, defense, etc. Talks should be happening for a specific purpose in the not too distant future.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Format: A formal presentation matching the format for the talk to be given.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leader Responsibilities: The talk should be a complete draft following the format for the planned presentation. To allow feedback on understandibility, engagement, and flow, the talk should be as complete as possible and ideally avoid &amp;lsquo;placeholder&amp;rsquo; slides and areas where the leader has to describe what they are planning to say rather than saying it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Group Duties: The presenter is looking to improve their talk, so feedback should be focused on improving the presentation for audience comprehension (i.e., How can the slides be improved?, Does the order of idea presentation have a logical flow?, etc). If you have scientific critiques and or suggestions for new analyses, please hold these comments until after lab meeting to avoid distracting from the goal of this session.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="research-updates">Research Updates&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Purpose: To communicate to the lab the overall trajectory of one&amp;rsquo;s research and get feedback from the lab on possible questions, alternatives, future work. This would be a hybrid of the communicative aspects of the Lightning Talk (but more in-depth) and the Problem-Solving Session (but less focused on a specific problem).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Format: A presentation that begins with the general questions in the field and any relevant previous work done by the leader, the status of current projects, and future planned projects and approaches. Think of this more as a narrative with past, present, and future; rather than a scientific presentation suitable for a seminar or conference.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leader Responsibilities: Communicate to the group the overall goals of your research, and be specific about what sections you&amp;rsquo;d like feedback on or discussion of. Are you looking for input on alternative methods or data to answer your research questions, feedback about the feasibility and scope of proposed work, suggestions for readings or courses, etc?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Group Duties: Provide specific and actionable feedback on topics as indicated by the leader. The focus is on the research questions and results, not the presentation, so the style of the presentation is not the focus. Remember that the goal of a research update will focus on in-progress and future work; providing guidance in the form of questions and constructive advice is important.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="problem-solving-sessions">Problem-Solving Sessions&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Purpose: To get feedback from the lab to address issues that are limiting progress. This could be getting feedback on statistical approaches, data collection issues, interpretation of results, computational challenges, or other activities. This is your chance to leverage the lab&amp;rsquo;s collective knowledge to address challenges you are facing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Format: A presentation that presents a single focal issue that the leader needs feedback on. The presentation should be focused and no longer than 15 minutes (5 minutes of background, 5 minutes explaining the problem, 1-3 explicit questions - i.e., not &amp;lsquo;what do you think?&amp;rsquo; - that you are asking the group).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leader Responsibilities: Communicate to the group a specific issue that the leader needs help with. This requires enough background and context for the group to understand both what the leader wants from the group and for the group to understand the scope of the problem at hand. The presentation does not need to be polished but it should be polished enough to not to be distracting. Be prepared to engage the group positively through question and answer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Group Duties: Provide focused feedback intended to help address the problem posed by the leader. The focus is on the problem, not the presentation, so the style of the presentation is not the focus. Remember that the goal of a problem solving sessions will typically focus on in-progress work and that providing help in positive, forward looking, ways is important.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="research-process-discussions">Research Process Discussions&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Purpose: To provide an opportunity for the group to informally discuss issues related to &amp;rsquo;the job of science&amp;rsquo; (i.e. career planning, grants, publishing, mentoring, etc).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Format: Open discussions of general topics, often with a focus on Questions &amp;amp; Answer interactions with Ethan &amp;amp; Morgan supplemented by additional perspectives from the broader group. These will typically be &amp;rsquo;led&amp;rsquo; by Morgan and Ethan with topics selected based on the general needs of the group.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leader Responsibilities: Make sure the lab is notified in advance of lab meeting so the group can come prepared with questions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Group Duties: Group members should think beforehand about their questions, issues, concerns about the topic and come prepared to actively engage to make sure they get what they need out of the discussion. While Ethan and Morgan will pick topics, suggestions are always welcome at the bottom of the semester&amp;rsquo;s lab meeting page and we may poll to get the groups perspective on what they want to discuss most.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="sprints">Sprints&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Purpose: To obtain help from the group to accomplish a task (i.e. data entry, software testing).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Format: A one hour focused period of work with tasks that can be accomplished during that hour.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leader Responsibilities: Leaders need to be organized beforehand with a plan for precisely what they want to accomplish, how they will organize the group to do this, and how much information needs to be conveyed to the group about what they are doing so they can do their tasks effectively and efficiently. The more organized the leader is, the more effective a sprint will be and the more positive the experience will be for everyone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Group Duties: The group in this context is working to help the leader attain their goal. Put aside other work for this period and focus on the task at hand. Ask questions if you are unclear on what is expected or if you encounter a situation not covered by the leader in the sprint briefing.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="talk-training">Talk Training&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Purpose: To provide more structure training activities related to designing and presenting a good talk.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Format: Variable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leader Responsibilities: To design material/activities that will help the group with structuring and designing talks and give them opportunities to practice.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Group Duties: Focus on talk structure and design and not details of the scientific content.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="team-building-activities">Team Building Activities&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Purpose: Activities to help break down barriers in the group and promote positive interactions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Format: Variable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leader Responsibilities: These activities will be organized by Ethan or Morgan, but all weecologists are welcome to make suggestions for group activities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Group Duties: Try to interact with members of the lab that you do not regularly interact with.&lt;/li>

A shared set of tools makes collaboration within the group easier because: 1) everyone knows how to use them; and 2) we&amp;rsquo;ve selected them over the years because we have found them to be effective for both local and remote collaboration. For tools involved in direct collaboration (e.g., Google Docs, GitHub) these tools should be used unless a specific decision has been made by the entire team to use a different tool set. For tools used directly only by individuals (e.g., RStudio) these are only recommendations.&lt;/p>

Your primary advisor is always happy to serve as a reference. If you&amp;rsquo;d also like a to get a reference from the other one of us just ask.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="process">Process&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="references">References&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In cases where all that is required is contact information for references just send us a short message in Slack that tells us you&amp;rsquo;re applying for the job and includes a link to the announcement.

&lt;h3 id="letters-of-recommendation">Letters of recommendation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In cases where we need to write a letter up front, do the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Provide us plenty of time, ideally at least two weeks (but don&amp;rsquo;t not ask for a letter if it has to happen at the last minute, we&amp;rsquo;ll figure out how to get it done). This is particularly important if it is the first time that we are writing this type of letter for you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Send a message that includes:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A link to the job/fellowship/award description&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The date the letter is due&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Details on how to submit the letters (typically either a link or an email address)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Anything you think is particularly important about the ad and/or that you&amp;rsquo;d like us to highlight. We typically develop a general letter, but are happy to customize in cases where that is useful.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We will contact you once we have sent the letter. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard from us 48 hours before it is due it is your responsibility to remind us.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The basic idea of parallelization is the running of computational tasks simultaneously, as opposed to sequentially (or &amp;ldquo;in parallel&amp;rdquo; as opposed to &amp;ldquo;in sequence&amp;rdquo;). To do this, the computer needs to be able to split code into pieces that can run independently and then be joined back together as if they had been run sequentially. The parts of the computer that run the pieces of code are processing units and are typically called &amp;ldquo;cores&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>doParallel&lt;/code> package is (as far as I&amp;rsquo;m currently aware) the most platform-general and robust parallel package available in R. There is more functionality for Unix-alikes in the &lt;code>parallel&lt;/code> package (see link below), but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t transfer to Windows machines.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">library(doParallel)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="cores-and-clusters">Cores and Clusters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At the outset, it&amp;rsquo;s important to know how many cores you have available, which the &lt;code>detectCores()&lt;/code> function returns. However, the value returned includes &amp;ldquo;hyperthreaded cores&amp;rdquo; (aka &amp;ldquo;logical cores&amp;rdquo;), which include further computational divvyings of the physical cores.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">detectCores()
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">detectCores(logical = FALSE)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Although hyperthreaded cores are available, they often do not show speed gains in R. However, as with everything parallel in R, it&amp;rsquo;s best to actually test that on the problem you&amp;rsquo;re working on, as there will be gains in certain situations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the user-interface level, we only interact at a single point, yet the code needs to access multiple cores at once. To achieve this, we have the concept of a &amp;ldquo;cluster&amp;rdquo;, which represents a parallel set of copies of R running across multiple cores (including across physical sockets). We create a cluster using the &lt;code>makeCluster&lt;/code> function and register the backend using the &lt;code>registerDoParallel&lt;/code> function:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">ncores &amp;lt;- detectCores(logical = FALSE)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">cl &amp;lt;- makeCluster(floor(0.75 * ncores))
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">registerDoParallel(cl)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">stopCluster(cl)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here, I&amp;rsquo;ve stopped the cluster explicitly using &lt;code>stopCluster&lt;/code>, which frees up the computational resources. The cluster will be automatically stopped when you end your R instance, but it&amp;rsquo;s a good habitat to be in to stop any clusters you make (even if you don&amp;rsquo;t register the backend).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="foreach-and-dopar">foreach and %dopar%&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Parallelization in &lt;code>doParallel&lt;/code> happens via the combination of the &lt;code>foreach&lt;/code> and &lt;code>%dopar%&lt;/code> operators in a fashion similar to &lt;code>for&lt;/code> loops. Rather than &lt;code>for(variable in values) {expression}&lt;/code>, we have &lt;code>foreach(variable = values, options) %dopar% {expression}&lt;/code>. Thus, the basic code block of a &lt;code>foreach&lt;/code> parallel loop is&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-gdscript3" data-lang="gdscript3">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="n">cl&lt;/span> &lt;span class="o">&amp;lt;-&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">makeCluster&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="nb">floor&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="mf">0.75&lt;/span> &lt;span class="o">*&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">ncores&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">))&lt;/span>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="n">foreach&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="n">variable&lt;/span> &lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">values&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">,&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">options&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">)&lt;/span> &lt;span class="o">%&lt;/span>&lt;span class="n">dopar&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">%&lt;/span> &lt;span class="p">{&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> &lt;span class="n">expression&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="p">}&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="n">stopCluster&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="n">cl&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">)&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Note that there can be multiple variable arguments (&lt;em>e.g.&lt;/em>, &lt;code>foreach(i = 1:10, j = 11:20) %dopar% {}&lt;/code>), although no variables are recycled, so the smallest number of values across variables is used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each of the instances of a &lt;code>foreach&lt;/code> is referred to as a &amp;ldquo;task&amp;rdquo; (a key word, especially in terms of error checking, see link below).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An important distinction between &lt;code>foreach&lt;/code> and &lt;code>for&lt;/code> is that &lt;code>foreach&lt;/code> returns a value (by default, a list), whereas &lt;code>for&lt;/code> causes side effects. Compare the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">cl &amp;lt;- makeCluster(floor(0.75 * ncores))
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">registerDoParallel(cl)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">out &amp;lt;- foreach(i = 1:10) %dopar% {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> i + rnorm(1, i, i)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">stopCluster(cl)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>vs.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">out &amp;lt;- vector(&amp;#34;list&amp;#34;, 10)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">for(i in 1:10){
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> out[[i]] &amp;lt;- i + rnorm(1, i, i)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>&lt;code>foreach&lt;/code> creates &lt;code>out&lt;/code>; &lt;code>for&lt;/code> modifies it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a handful of option arguments in &lt;code>foreach&lt;/code> that are really critical for anything beyond trivial computation:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>.packages&lt;/code> passes the libraries down to the cluster of Rs. If you don&amp;rsquo;t include package names and you use a package-derived function, it won&amp;rsquo;t work&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>.combine&lt;/code> dictates how the output is combined, defaulting to a list, but allowing lots of flexibility including mathematical operations. If needed, the &lt;code>.init&lt;/code> option allows you to initialize the value (for example with 0 or 1).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>.inorder&lt;/code> sets whether the combination happens based on the order of inputs. If the order isn&amp;rsquo;t important, setting this to &lt;code>FALSE&lt;/code> can give performance gains.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>.errorhandling&lt;/code> determines what happens when a task fails (see link below for using &lt;code>tryCatch&lt;/code> within tasks).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In addition to &lt;code>%dopar%&lt;/code>, there is a sequential operator for use with &lt;code>foreach&lt;/code>, and it is simply &lt;code>%do%&lt;/code>. Replacing &lt;code>%dopar%&lt;/code> with &lt;code>%do%&lt;/code> will cause the code to run in-order, as if you did not initiate a cluster. Similarly, you can run &lt;code>foreach&lt;/code> and &lt;code>%dopar%&lt;/code> without having made a cluster, but the code will be run sequentially.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="nesting-foreach-loops">Nesting foreach loops&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Nested loops can often be really powerful for computation. &lt;code>doParallel&lt;/code> has a special operator that combines two &lt;code>foreach&lt;/code> objects in a nested manner: &lt;code>%:%&lt;/code>. This operator causes the outer most &lt;code>foreach&lt;/code> to be evaluated over its variables&amp;rsquo; values, which are then passed down into the next innermost &lt;code>foreach&lt;/code>. That &lt;code>foreach&lt;/code> iterates over its variables&amp;rsquo; values for each value of the outer &lt;code>foreach&lt;/code> variables.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">cl &amp;lt;- makeCluster(floor(0.75 * ncores))
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">registerDoParallel(cl)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">out &amp;lt;- foreach(i = 1:10) %:%
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> foreach(j = 1:100) %dopar% {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> i * j^3
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">out
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">stopCluster(cl)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The &lt;code>.combine&lt;/code> option is really important to pay attention to with nested &lt;code>foreach&lt;/code> loops, as it will allow you to flexibly structure the data. The above version produces a list (length 10) of lists (length 100).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="seeds-and-rngs">Seeds and RNGs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the downfalls of &lt;code>foreach&lt;/code> and &lt;code>%dopar%&lt;/code> is that the parallel runs aren&amp;rsquo;t reproducible in a simple way. There are ways to code seed setting up, but it&amp;rsquo;s a little obtuse. Thankfully, the &lt;code>doRNG&lt;/code> package has you taken care of. There are a few ways to code up a reproducible parallel loop.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The degree to which your code speeds up when you parallelize it depends on a few factors: how many cores you have, whether the code can take advantage of hyperthreading, the run time of the code itself, and your ease of coding in parallel. There is definitely some computational and time overhead involved in setting up a cluster, distributing the work, and combining the results. Short tasks (seconds to a half-minute), therefore, are usually faster to run in sequence. Once tasks start creeping up to the half-minute mark on a dual-core machine (or the less time on a more-core machine), the parallel runs will start to be faster. As the runtime of the computation increases, the relative gain by parallelizing increases, although it never gets to a fully fractional decrease of time (&lt;em>i.e.&lt;/em>, 6 cores won&amp;rsquo;t ever get you to 1/6 the runtime&amp;hellip;probably more like 1/4 - 1/5) due to overhead. The other thing to keep in mind with parallelization is that there is often some additional coding time involved, and there can be issues that require an additional level of troubleshooting that quickly eliminates the time gains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See references below for speed tests.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>What should you do if you encounter one? &lt;strong>Call Glenda!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Portal Data Entry and QA</title><link>http://localhost:1313/docs/field-work/portal-data-entry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/field-work/portal-data-entry/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Open data&lt;/strong> is &lt;em>good&lt;/em> but &lt;strong>clean data&lt;/strong> is &lt;em>better&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below are guidelines/instructions for entering and QAing each type of data we collect that previous Portal RAs have developed to systematically update and ensure the quality of Portal data.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="rodent-data">Rodent Data&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Ideally, rodent data are entered and QA&amp;rsquo;ed before the next rodent census trip. This ensures no back logs in tasks, and that &lt;a href="https://github.com/weecology/portalcasting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portalcasting&lt;/a> is able to generate new forecasts based on the latest data point available.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="data-entry">Data entry&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Scan data sheets and deposit on Portal Dropbox folder: Portal -&amp;gt; PORTAL_primary_data -&amp;gt; Rodent -&amp;gt; Raw_data -&amp;gt; datasheet_scans -&amp;gt; year. Make sure to rename file to appropriate census period.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enter data and have field technician do the second entry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open folder with .xls files of the rodent data: Portal -&amp;gt; PORTAL_primary_data -&amp;gt; Rodent -&amp;gt; Raw_data -&amp;gt; New_data. Copy a previous one, and rename file with the appropriate census date (Ex. newdatXX.xlsx).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enter rodent data on DE1 tab (field technician enters data on DE2 tab).
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When filling in the year, encode full year value (Ex. Encode 2024 instead of 24).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When dragging down repetitive values (e.g., month, day, year, plot), make sure that the values are copied over in the target cells (i.e., make sure that when you drag down, the values are not increasing).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use all caps in all columns.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Under the tag column, the usual values are 6-characters long. The characters range from numbers 0-9 and letters A-E.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In rows where individuals got &lt;em>new tags&lt;/em>, put an asterisk (*) under note2.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Notes of individuals being dead (D), removed (R), or escaped (E) should be put under the column note5.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Download PIT tags (Note: You need a Windows machine with BioTerm installed. The weather station laptop works.)
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Connect the scanner using the USB adapter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open BioTerm. Make sure the BAUD rate is 9600. Select Open.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using the scanner, press READ, then MENU until it says &amp;ldquo;Stored ID tags&amp;rdquo;. Press the up arrow, then READ. It will ask if you want to send all tags. Press READ. The tags &lt;em>should&lt;/em> appear in the BioTerm text box. You may need to squeeze the adapter into the scanner so you get a really secure connection (the screw is really difficult to turn all the way). In theory you can also type &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo; into the BioTerm text box and the tags will appear.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open the Notepad application. Copy the tags from the BioTerm text box into an empty text file in Notepad.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Save the file with the new tags with the census number (tags###.txt) in the Portal Dropbox folder: Portal -&amp;gt; PORTAL_primary_data -&amp;gt; Rodent -&amp;gt; Raw_data -&amp;gt; New_data -&amp;gt; tag scans.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Delete old PIT tag scans
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>NOTE: This should only occur after you have completed data QA!&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once you have completed all data QA, you will want to delete the previous PIT tag scans from the scanner so they do not get read into next month&amp;rsquo;s tag scans file.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using the scanner, press READ, then MENU unitl it says &amp;ldquo;Stored ID tags.&amp;rdquo; Press the up arrow twice; at this point, the scanner should read &amp;ldquo;Delete tags?&amp;rdquo; with the default set to NO. Press READ to select YES, then press the up arrow.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you check the stored tags, the number should now read 000.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="data-qa">Data QA&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In GitHub (remote):&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Make sure you have write access to the PortalData repo (ask Glenda about this).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>clone the repo by following the instructions &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a>. Note: You only need to do this once.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>create new branch and rename it to: rodents_censusperiod (Make sure you are in the correct repo: PortalData). Follow instructions &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In RStudio (local):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Click File -&amp;gt; New Project -&amp;gt; Existing Directory and browse to where PortalData is saved in your computer and open it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the terminal tab in RStudio, type:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>git pull (assuming you are in the main branch, do this to make sure that you have the latest version of the files)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>git checkout rodents_censusperiod (make sure you are working on the new branch you just created. The top part of your RStudio should reflect this)
Note: If updates in the main branch were merged while you are working in your branch, do:&lt;/li>
&lt;li>git checkout main&lt;/li>
&lt;li>git pull&lt;/li>
&lt;li>git checkout rodents_censusperiod&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the Files tab in RStudio, go to PortalData -&amp;gt; DataCleaningScripts, and click on new_rodent_data.r.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run code from lines 1 to 11, and update line 18 to the correct census period number.
Note: If you are using a Windows Machine:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>line 20 (filepath= &amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo;) should have 2 back slashes after each location (Ex.: filepath= D:\Dropbox\Portal\PORTAL_primary_data\Rodent\Raw_data\New_data)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>line 22 (newfile=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;), there should be 2 back slashesbefore the word newdat (Ex.: paste(filepath, &amp;lsquo;\newdat&amp;rsquo;, newperiod, &amp;lsquo;.xlsx&amp;rsquo;, sep = &amp;lsquo;&amp;rsquo;))&lt;/li>
&lt;li>line 23 (scannerfile=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;), there should be 2 back slashes before the phrase tag scans and tags (Ex.: paste(filepath, &amp;lsquo;\tag scans\tags&amp;rsquo;, newperiod, &amp;lsquo;.txt&amp;rsquo;, sep = &amp;lsquo;&amp;rsquo;))&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run line 29. Corect the .xlsx worksheets until they match.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once the sheets are identical, run lines 36 to 38. If errors pop up, update Excel file and note changes in the red notebook.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run subsequent lines and make necessary changes. Note them in the red notebok. This is so we can track the decisions on the species/sex/etc. IDs that were made. scan previous months&amp;rsquo; corrections to make sure you&amp;rsquo;re not &amp;lsquo;correcting&amp;rsquo; the same individuals back and forth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Save R file.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Push to GitHub repo by clicking on the Git tab in RStudio, and selecting the files that were updated (Usually, this includes 2 files: new_rodent_data.r and Portal_rodent.csv).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>make sure to write an intuitive commit message. Ex.: add rodent census XXX data [minor]).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In Github:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Go to the Weecology PortalData repo and click the message that says a new commit has been pushed by you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tag Glenda as a reviewer and create a pull request by clicking the create pull request button at the bottom of that page.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If it passes all checks/tests,you&amp;rsquo;re good to go! If not, go to the PR (pull request) page and read the details where the error occurred. Fix issues accordingly.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Click File -&amp;gt; New Project -&amp;gt; Existing Directory and browse to where PortalData is saved in your computer and open it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the terminal tab in RStudio, type:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>git pull (to make sure that you have the latest version of the files)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>git checkout plants-season-year (make sure you are working on the new branch you just created)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the Files tab in R, go to PortalData -&amp;gt; DataCleaningScripts, and click on clean_plant_quadrat_data.R.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run all lines of code and don&amp;rsquo;t forget to update line 29 and 30 to the correct season and year.
Note: If you are using a Windows Machine:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>line 32 (filepath= &amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo;) should have 2 back slashes after each location (Ex.: filepath= D:\Dropbox\Portal\PORTAL_primary_data\Plant\Quadrats\Dataraw\Newdata\)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Address all issues until the datasheets are matched.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Notes:&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You do not need to do all these in one sitting, especially when entering and QAing the plant data. Just make sure you save your changes locally.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Follow the steps for QAing the rodent data to create a PR for the new plant data. Again, make sure to write intuitive commit messages every time you push &lt;em>new&lt;/em> changes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The following tags for commit messages in Github should be used accordingly:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>[major] - use if you&amp;rsquo;ve made a breaking change (e.g changed the shape of a data table). This will update the version from 1.88.0 to 2.0, for example.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>[minor] - use if you&amp;rsquo;re adding new data. This is the default so no tags in a commit message will assume this. This will update the version from 1.88.0 to 1.89.0, for example.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>[patch] - use if you&amp;rsquo;ve made a small change to existing data (eg fixed species or sex, or a typo, etc), without adding new data. This will update from 1.88.0 to 1.88.1, for example.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>[no version bump] - This would usually be for changes to code that don&amp;rsquo;t change data at all (eg, adding tests). The version number will not change, and the update won&amp;rsquo;t get archived on Zenodo.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Add census dates to Portal Google calendar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Put together field crew.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>During the summer months, a crew of 4 (including RA) is ideal for the rodent census. Portal plant census trips may benefit from more people.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Local&amp;rdquo; volunteers (Tucson-based folks) sign up in this &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/6XXCzp5bUzgG6XNA9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">form&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Submit the volunteer form for any new volunteers that need reimbursement or if you are purchasing any travel for them:

&lt;li>University of Florida Affiliation Status - Volunteer
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Even grad students at UF should choose the status Volunteer.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Local Mailing Address - where you want to receive your reimbursement check, if different from permanent address&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Local physical (work site) address is: BLM land, Desert Willow Rd, Cochise County, AZ).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Are you expecting travel payment or reimbursements? - Yes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Are you requesting to also become a Volunteer? - Yes&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Book Travel
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>File a &lt;a href="https://wec.ifas.ufl.edu/resources/ufgo-travel-forms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blanket travel request&lt;/a> for all crew members. Choose Option 2 and fill the form accordingly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Book flights and lodging for yourself and all non-UF field crew members using &lt;a href="https://www.concursolutions.com/home.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UFGO&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Coordinate with other UF employees to book their travel similarly.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(&lt;em>Optional&lt;/em>) A week before travel, reach out to volunteers to get food/drink requests and order groceries online (e.g., Walmart), and just do a pick-up the day you drive down to the site.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In Tucson
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Pick up field truck in the off airport parking lot. Use the PCard to pay for it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pickup/buy groceries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fill water containers (in Walmart, Watermill Express or other refilling stations)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fill gas&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>Remember you are on the AZ-NM border, and they are in separate time zones half the year. NM is MDT/MST, while AZ is always MST. Keep the clock in the truck on AZ time, then you never have to change it. Phones usually are on NM time, but it can depend on the carrier and where you are standing. There is a digital alarm clock in the truck you can use so you have a consistent time piece for waking up in the morning. Portal and everything up Cave Creek Canyon operates on AZ time. Sky Island Grill, the Chiricahua Desert Museum and Rodeo are on NM time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are starting to get some useful resources in the Portal-Rodeo area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://portal-rodeo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Portal-Rodeo community&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.portallodge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Portal Store&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will need a lot of firewood to keep your volunteers warm and happy through the winter. To get a supply for the whole winter, go to the Portal Store and ask for the number of who is currently delivering firewood, or it will be posted there or at the Library. Some will deliver, or you can pick it up in town. Use your per diem, do not put it on your P Card!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="rodent-census">Rodent Census&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A Portal weekend consists of two nights of rodent trapping. We drive down to the site no later than mid-day (can be a bit later during the summer). The drive is ~3 hrs long. Once we get there, we set camp and just before sunset we&amp;rsquo;ll set traps on 12 plots (refer to trapping map in Dropbox to determine which plots are set on the first and second night), which takes about 2 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The GoalZero battery, which we use to charge our electronic devices and power the camp lights, need to be set-up/charged using the solar panel. Prop the solar panel up in the small mound next to the ramada, and make sure it is facing the sun (You may need to adjust it throughout the day). Connect the wire to the extension cord and plug the extension cord to the GoalZero battery. Make sure that the green light in the charger plug is on. It is ideal that the camp lights and the stove are also set up before heading out to the plots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When out setting traps on Day 1, the RA can opt to visit the locations of the camera traps and collect/replace the SD cards and/or replace batteries (Note: labels on the SD cards refer to the location of the camera trap. Ex. 21 west means it is the SD card used for the camera trap located on the west side of the plot NOT where it is facing). Camera traps are currently at the east and west side of the gates on plots 11 and 21.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next day, we get up just before dawn, get a light breakfast, and head out to the plots. We process animals in the plots so make sure to pack water and snacks (&amp;ldquo;exiled&amp;rdquo; rodents are taken out of the site). The RA will be the one actually handling the animals while the volunteer records data and assists with equipment. Volunteers can handle &amp;ldquo;exiled&amp;rdquo; rodents if they are interested.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Later in the afternoon/early evening, we&amp;rsquo;ll set traps on the other half of the plots (n=12). The next morning will be the same as previous, where we process rodents in the plots. No later than mid-day, we&amp;rsquo;ll break camp, the RA collects data from the weather station, and then, we head back to Tucson.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="guides">Guides&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The following rodent trapping-related field guides are in the Portal Dropbox for you to study. Also keep hard copies in the field to reference:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Dropbox/Portal/FieldGuides/Smammal_trapping_protocol.doc: instructional guide on the trap setting and data collection protocol&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dropbox/Portal/FieldGuides/Trapping_map.pptx: a diagram of the plot locations and the trapping schedule (i.e., details on which plots you need to set traps in on each day, and where trap boxes need to be moved to for the second day of trapping)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dropbox/Portal/FieldGuides/Rodent_ID_cards.pdf: descriptive field guide on all the rodent species recorded on site. Use when uncertain about the identity of the animal on hand&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Check millet supply. If low, schedule a trip to a pet store. &lt;a href="https://okfeedaz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OK Feed and Pet Supply&lt;/a> sells a 50 lbs bag of white millet for ~$30. Use PCard to pay for it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clean inside of field truck.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Drain cooler. Leave lid slightly ajar and crack open window of the bed of the truck to to vent it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Set-up the solar panel so that the GoalZero battery gets charged. Place the solar panel in the dashboard horizontally and plug the wire to the GoalZero battery. (If the battery isn&amp;rsquo;t charge well, you can bring it in the hotel room and charge it first).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Drop off field truck at the off airport poarking lot. &lt;strong>Remember to take a photo of the stub/card they give you in the free shuttle.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;p>We conduct plant census trips twice a year: Once in the winter (around late March/early April) and once in the summer (around late August/early September). The dates vary based on its proximity to the new moon date of those months because we also do rodent census during this trip. Ideally, this is conducted with atleast 4 people. Usually, we stay at the site for 1 week during these trips. During the winter plant census, we only do quadrats. During the summer, we do BOTH transect and quadrats. Sampling protocol described &lt;a href="https://github.com/weecology/PortalData/blob/main/SiteandMethods/Methods.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a>. Allocation of the time for each task (rodent/plant data collection) can vary depending upon your arrival time on site and weather. It is recommended that site maintenance be done during this trip (e.g., fix trap boxes, fix gates, stomp out holes within 1m of the fences, clearing trails, etc.).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="some-other-things-to-keep-in-mind">Some other things to keep in mind&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You can let volunteers know they don&amp;rsquo;t need to bring anything (coffee, snacks, plates, utensils, first aid, etc.) unless they want to. We take care of all food and most supplies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Also warn volunteers this is a rustic camping situation, meaning no bathroom facilities and no water supply except what we bring in. We have several large jugs we can fill for drinking and washing dishes, but they may want to bring wet wipes or other personal hygeine supplies to be comfortable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It may be quite cold in December - February (it has been known to freeze overnight)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It will definitely be quite hot in May - August&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is somewhat limited cell reception at the site, depending on your carrier&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We camp out in the desert. The bed of the truck is spacious enough to fit 2 tall people. The back seat inside the truck can also be used but will only be comfortable for those under 5'4&amp;quot;. There is an extra 2-person tent in the truck that anyone can use. Anyone is welcome to bring/set up a tent near the ramada, there are a few established spots.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>There is a medical clinic in Portal staffed by a Nurse Practitioner on Tuesday mornings and Thursday and Friday afternoons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some emergency personnel will generally be on call in the Portal area, or someone at the Portal store or Sky Island Grill will know where they are. Lately, we&amp;rsquo;ve met Marty Allred of Cochise County Search and Rescue, and Carolyn Nordstrom of Portal Fire and Rescue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a walk-in urgent care facility in Douglas, about 60 minutes south on Route 80. (520-364-7659). The closest hospitals are in Willcox, about 90 minutes northwest by car and in Bisbee, about 90 minutes southwest by car. Portal and Rodeo both have excellent EMT, ambulance and search and rescue capabilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="urgent-care">Urgent Care&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Copper Queen Community Hospital Douglas Rural Health Clinic: There is an &amp;ldquo;Emergency Department&amp;rdquo; which is open 24-hours a day, including weekends and holidays. It describes itself as &amp;ldquo;urgent care on steroids&amp;rdquo;. Anything serious (i.e. potentially life threatening, should be a 9-1-1 call. If you get really sick or experience a non-life threatening injury, then this is probably where you want to go.

&lt;h4 id="emergency-room">Emergency Room&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>While Bisbee is equally close, if you are at the site and this isn&amp;rsquo;t a call 9-1-1 emergency but you think you need an emergency room, then Willcox is probably where you want to go. Wilcox is more straight forward to drive to (on the interstate) than Bisbee (up in the mountains). But if you are already in Douglas, or if you are someplace where Bisbee is closer than Wilcox, then go there!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To the best of our collective knowledge, nobody has ever contracted a disease because of fieldwork with the Portal rodents. Possible diseases that could be contracted through contact with rodents are:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hantavirus: contracted through inhalation of dried feces/urine, usually in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation. It is carried by Murid rodents. This is a severe disease with a high fatality rate but there is &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2857298/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">little evidence that mammalogists contract this disease from handling rodents in open-air conditions&lt;/a>. Don&amp;rsquo;t disturb the woodrat midden, and avoid kicking up rodent-y dust. American society of mammalogist suggestions can be found here: &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/91/6/1524/892462" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/91/6/1524/892462&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rabies: This is theoretically a risk from fieldwork at the site but transmission by squirrel-sized or smaller rodents is &lt;a href="https://www.mdedge.com/emergencymedicine/article/174385/infectious-diseases/when-rodents-attack-review-rabies-and-post" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extremely rare&lt;/a>. More likely (though still extremely rare) would be an attack from a larger mammal such as a coyote, fox, skunk, or raccoon. If one of these species is observed behaving strangely or aggressively, care should be taken as they can and do transmit rabies. A bite from one of these animals should be reported immediately to a nearby medical facility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bubonic Plague or other ectoparasite carried diseases: There are no incidents of bubonic plague in humans near our field site (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps/index.html&lt;/a>) so this is considered a very unlikely event. However, our animals do have ectoparasites. We have seen no evidence of these ectoparasites jumping to humans (no one becomes flea infested or has found themselves with ticks), but people should inspect themselves after being in the field.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="humans">Humans&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There are pepper spray guns in the driver and passenger door wells of the truck.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you feel unsafe sleeping at the site, there are other places to camp. RAs have used Rusty&amp;rsquo;s RV Ranch, and there are campsites up the canyon past Portal. Sunny Flat and Stewart are open year-round and cost $20 a night each; make sure you have cash. They are about 3 miles up the canyon past the Portal store. The lodge is an option in a pinch. It closes for check in at 6.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a heavy Border Patrol presence in the area. There have not been any negative interactions between Border Patrol and project personnel and the state vehicle provides some protections as it shows you are affiliated with governmental organizations. But everyone should be aware that at a national level there are a number of reported incidents of US citizens and legal immigrants being detained. We recommend traveling with identification and potentially your passport. We will also provide a letter on UF letterhead with the names of the project personnel as an added protection. If you would like a letter that also mentions your volunteer, contact Glenda or Morgan and they can provide one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Portal Vehicle Guide</title><link>http://localhost:1313/docs/field-work/portal-vehicle-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/field-work/portal-vehicle-guide/</guid><description>&lt;p>The field vehicle is a 2015 Toyota Tundra.&lt;/p>

Once you leave Tucson, you&amp;rsquo;re on a tight schedule to get everything done, and services get thinner until they&amp;rsquo;re basically nonexistent. We have had no luck getting a tow truck to come to the site. There are lots of capable folks around Portal, but organizing help will burn a day or more. And take care to avoid avoidable disasters - take good care of the battery, don&amp;rsquo;t leave the accessories on without turning the truck on, watch your fuel gauge, hang the keys in the same place in the ramada every time so you don&amp;rsquo;t lock them in the truck, don&amp;rsquo;t drive excessively fast on the dirt road so you don&amp;rsquo;t pop a tire or rattle something loose.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="monthly-maintenance">Monthly Maintenance&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Before you leave the parking lot, do a &amp;lsquo;walk-around.&amp;rsquo; Deal with any issues before you leave Tucson. If you&amp;rsquo;re already on your way, Wilcox is another good place to stop.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Check for (new) dents/scratches&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Check the tires, including the spare - are they low? is the tread wearing thin?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Check the headlights/taillights/running lights&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Note how the vehicle starts - does it seem slow? does it sound wierd?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brakes - do they seem sluggish or noisy?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Warning lights - Be mindful of these - the only normal light is the regular maintenance light, which should come on about the time we need an annual inspection.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windshield wipers - these are safety equipment! And they&amp;rsquo;re cheap to replace, especially compared to the rest of the truck. If they start to be less-than-perfect, get them replaced ASAP at AutoZone/Napa/etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Refill out of stock or expired items in the first aid kit&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jumper cables are under the back seat. Use another vehicle if you have one available, otherwise use the:&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jumpstarter - this is a big red box that lives in the truck. You can use it to jumpstart the battery if it has recently died and the battery is healthy. Keep the jumpstart battery healthy by charging it in a hotel room whenever you get a chance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Before you head back to Tucson, check for rodents trying to make a home in the truck.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="tool-kit">Tool Kit&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A tool kit lives in the bed of the truck. Feel free to stock it with whatever you need, and put it on your P Card (eg for repairing cattle fence, ramada, trap boxes, plot fences).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="first-aid-kit">First aid kit&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This lives in the backseat of the truck. Check it regularly for out of stock items and expired meds. This is covered by per diem (not P card).
Oft-requested items from volunteers:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Bandaids, all sizes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Neosporin&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bite/sting ointment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wraps&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Medical Tape&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Aleve/Ibuprofen/Tylenol&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Allegra/Zyrtec&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Benadryl&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dramamine&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eye drops&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tweezers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nail clippers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Scissors&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tampons&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="annual-maintenance">Annual Maintenance&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Once a year, we make an appointment at &lt;a href="https://www.deserttoyota.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Desert Toyota&lt;/a> to service the truck. Usually this is done before the spring plant census, since we have extra time.
Kyle Brooks is our service advisor. Always &lt;a href="https://www.deserttoyota.com/service-appointment-advisor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make an appointment&lt;/a> in advance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When making the appointment, request:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Lube, Oil and Filter Change&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Air Filter - Replace&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cabin Air Filter - Replace&lt;/li>
&lt;li>any suggested Mileage-based service (eg 25,000 Mile Service)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tires - Rotate and Balance&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brakes - Clean and Adjust&lt;/li>
&lt;li>any specific concern you have&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The mechanics will decide what is actually necessary when they look at it, but this will (hopefully) budget enough time to get everything done. In general, just have them do everything they suggest. Kyle knows the vehicle is used under special circumstances and will make reccomendations based on that. Ask they run it through the car wash before you leave. Check the tires are properly mounted before you drive away!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We get the tires replaced at Discount Tire (not Desert Toyota). If Kyle says they need to be replaced, you can usually get in the same day.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="saftey-inspections">Saftey Inspections&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Annual saftey inspections are required by &lt;a href="https://www.facilitiesservices.ufl.edu/departments/operations/motor-pool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UF Motor Pool&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The inspection checklist provided by Desert Toyota with your invoice works for this. Email it to &lt;a href="mailto:motorpool@facilitiesservices.ufl.edu">motorpool@facilitiesservices.ufl.edu&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="az-collecting-permit">AZ Collecting Permit&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Morgan will be issued an AZ Collecting Permit each year, to allow trapping rodents. This should live in the truck.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t get one for the new year, ask Morgan.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="registration">Registration&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A sticker should be sent to Morgan every year. If it&amp;rsquo;s out of date, ask Morgan.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="insurance">Insurance&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This does not change and does not need to be in the vehicle. The government plates and sticker should be sufficient. But, if someone requests it, you can request a &lt;a href="https://www.ehs.ufl.edu/forms/risk-management-forms/request-a-certificate-of-coverage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certificate of coverage&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Portal Volunteer Guide</title><link>http://localhost:1313/docs/field-work/portal-volunteer-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/field-work/portal-volunteer-guide/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="uf-paperwork">UF paperwork&lt;/h2>

&lt;li>Depending on the month, it could be very hot (May-August) or very cold (November-March).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hiking boots &amp;amp; socks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sandals or flip flops
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>For cooler months, I recommend an extra pair of warm socks to go under your sandals or camping slippers&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hiking pants&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2-3 tshirts or tanktops&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An overshirt to keep the sun off&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A hat for sun&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clothes for traveling and hanging out in Tucson&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sunblock&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sunglasses&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chapstick&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 water bottles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A headlamp + batteries&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There are 2 tents available for group use. You can bring a tent if you prefer your own.
You can bring electronics, although there is a risk of them getting dusty or rained on. We have limited solar power.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="traveling-logistics">Traveling logistics&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="flying">Flying&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Your travel expenses will be covered.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep track of how much you spend getting to the airport (taxi, public transit fee, or gas + a per mile reimbursement if you drive your own car).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep track of how much you spend on meals while traveling. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to keep the receipts, but they can be helpful for keeping track of your expenses.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Depending on when you arrive, the RA will pick you up in Tucson in our field truck. There is also a hotel shuttle that can pick you up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We often have to gate check rollaboard carryons. If you gate check your bag, make sure to confirm whether to pick it up planeside or at baggage claim. Make sure you keep essential items, including medication, with you at all times.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="in-tucson">In Tucson&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Generally, the RA will pay for things because it&amp;rsquo;s easier to keep track of the reimbursement that way. If you need to buy something, keep track of how much it was.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thursday night, we&amp;rsquo;ll probably get dinner and then go back to the hotel.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Friday morning, we&amp;rsquo;ll go grocery shopping, fill up on water, and eat lunch in Tucson.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s a 3 hour drive to the site from Tucson. We&amp;rsquo;ll stop halfway to fill up on gas. The travel stop has good bathrooms.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="portal">Portal&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="safety">Safety&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We want to maintain a field experience that is as safe and accessible as possible. Please bring any medications you will need. If you have any medical conditions that may pose a risk to your safety while in the field, please let the RA know so we can make good decisions. If anything might be exacerbated by stress, walking, heat and cold, or changes in diet, bear this in mind. If there are any accommodations we can make to improve your comfort or safety, we are more than happy to do that (and get creative!). If at any time you feel like work at the site is causing you harm, prioritize your health and safety, you can always opt out.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stay hydrated! We bring lots of water, and we can go up the canyon to get more.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Human health is more important than data. Take breaks when you need them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We have a basic first aid kit in the truck. The RAs have some first aid training, but may not be currently certified.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wash your hands after touching traps or rodents.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If any food/utensils fall on the ground, don&amp;rsquo;t eat it or use them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;ve never had a problem with rodent-borne disease or parasites.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There aren&amp;rsquo;t any large dangerous predators at the site.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is pepper spray in the driver side door of the truck.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="creatures">Creatures&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There are rattlesnakes, scorpions, spiders, and centipedes at the site. Look before you put your hand into anything that might be described as a crevice.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Rattlesnakes&lt;/em>: Stay alert for a rattle. We have gaiters we use to cover our ankles when we&amp;rsquo;re walking around the site in the summer. Be especially alert moving quickly through clumps of grass and when opening/closing gates.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Scorpions&lt;/em>: Be careful about sticking your hand into dense clumps of grass or under rocks. Use a headlamp at night to avoid scorpions. Keep your shoes inside a tent/the truck, or make sure you shake them out before you put your feet in them. Most of the scorpions at the site probably have painful but not dangerous stings. The Arizona bark scorpion (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_bark_scorpion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_bark_scorpion&lt;/a>) is potentially harmful, most are not.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Spiders&lt;/em>: We definitely have black widows and we might have brown recluses.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is a large woodrat midden in the corner of the ramada (our shed). We don&amp;rsquo;t really touch it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="logistics">Logistics&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We sleep in the truck, either in the back (it is a closed bed pickup truck, so the back of the truck has room for two tall people to stretch out). Volunteers can pitch tents around the area where we park the truck, there are a few established spots. A tent is available for use, or you can bring your own.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We go to the bathroom in a designated area a little way away from the camping area. We pack out toilet paper, and bury waste when appropriate. We may be able to drive to flush toilets during the day on Saturday, but unfortunately there&amp;rsquo;s no way for us to completely avoid having to go to the bathroom outdoors. Bring wet wipes or other personal hygeine supplies as you prefer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We carry several large containers of water for drinking, cooking, and washing. Use as much as you need. We can refill on Saturday if necessary.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are no showers at the site.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Please let the RA know about dietary restrictions and preferences. We&amp;rsquo;re happy to get whatever groceries we need.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no electricity at the site. We do have a solar panel, which allows us to run small electronics (LED lights, charging phones, etc).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We will not trap if there is &amp;gt; 50% chance of rain and the overnight low is goign to be &amp;lt; 45 degrees. This is to keep the rodents from getting too cold.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="friday-afternoonevening">Friday afternoon/evening&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;ll unpack the truck and set up our living space.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>About three hours before sunset, we&amp;rsquo;ll head out to set traps.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In all, we trap 12 plots per night.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some of the plots have &amp;lsquo;gates&amp;rsquo;, little holes to let the right set of rodents come and go. We have to close the gates before we set traps. Someone walks the perimeter of the plot and covers the gates with a bit of hardware cloth and a rock.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We set one trap at each of 49 stakes in each plot. Each trap gets a handful of millet and is placed facing a random direction, close to the stake.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="saturday-morning">Saturday morning&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;ll get up about half an hour before sunrise to eat breakfast and get going.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bring a snack and water with you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As soon as there&amp;rsquo;s enough light to see, we&amp;rsquo;ll head out to check traps.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Rodent processing&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;ll need to open all the gates.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The RA will handle the rodents, and you will record data.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every month we have some rodents who got onto plots that they&amp;rsquo;re not supposed to be able to access. We take them far away from the site and release them. You can process some of the &amp;rsquo;exiles&amp;rsquo; if you want to, but there&amp;rsquo;s no pressure to if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="saturday-afternoonevening">Saturday afternoon/evening&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Is free time. We may have some maintenance to do.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Three hours before sunset, we&amp;rsquo;ll head out to set the second half of the traps.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="sunday-morning">Sunday morning&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;ll get up before sunrise and have breakfast, then head out and process the second night of rodents.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;ll put all the traps back in the trap shed, and pack up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Usually we leave the site in the early afternoon to drive back to Tucson. We&amp;rsquo;ll stop at the same gas station halfway through the drive.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="sunday-nightmonday-morning-in-tucson">Sunday night/Monday morning in Tucson&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;ll stay at a hotel, depending on when our flights are.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;ll get dinner in Tucson. Breakfast is provided at the hotel.&lt;/li>

&lt;h4 id="weather-station">WEATHER STATION&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Our weather station is from &lt;a href="http://www.campbellsci.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Campbell Scientific&lt;/a> and it is a very fancy beast. Admittedly, the windy, sandy, chewy-rodenty desert is not an ideal environment to be working with expensive and temperamental electronics. Especially at the end of a long weekend of rodent trapping, when you&amp;rsquo;re tired and dirty, the sun makes it difficult to see the screen, and it seems your laptop could melt at any moment. Countless RAs before you know your pain. Rest assured, there is documentation to help you with whatever you need to figure out or do. If you can&amp;rsquo;t find how to do something, just ask Glenda, or the previous RA. As always, if something isn&amp;rsquo;t clear enough or could use improvement, please feel free to update it or suggest modifications. And if you have any tips or tricks you discover along the way, please add them to help out future Weecologists!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="monthly-ra-tasks">Monthly RA tasks&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The vast majority of the time, you will only be briefly connecting to the station to download data. Celebrate the accomplishment that is a simple month.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Do a quick &amp;lsquo;walk-around&amp;rsquo; of the station and make sure everything is alright
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>nothing is knocked over&lt;/li>
&lt;li>connections all look secure&lt;/li>
&lt;li>charging regulator light is on&lt;/li>
&lt;li>no cables are frayed or chewed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>wind sensor is spinning freely&lt;/li>
&lt;li>rain gauge isn&amp;rsquo;t clogged and is level&lt;/li>
&lt;li>modem lights indicate power and a data connection&lt;/li>
&lt;li>phenocam is sending pictures that are centered and focused&lt;/li>
&lt;li>check the humidity meter in the datalogger enclosure
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>if it&amp;rsquo;s pink, replace the desiccant packs (in the &amp;ldquo;cable bag&amp;rdquo; in the truck)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t happen often (every few years), if you replace them more frequently, check the enclosure for leaks&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Download data from the 2016 station
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Look at the current data before downloading to check it looks reasonable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rename files &lt;em>&lt;code>periodcode&lt;/code>&lt;/em>&lt;code>_CR1000_MET.dat&lt;/code> and &lt;em>&lt;code>periodcode&lt;/code>&lt;/em>&lt;code>_CR1000_Storms.dat&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Move files to &lt;code>/UFL Dropbox/Portal/PORTAL_primary_data/Weather/Raw_data/2016_Station&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Download data from the 2002 station
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Look at the current data before downloading to check it looks reasonable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Change filename to &lt;code>Met&lt;/code>&lt;em>&lt;code>periodcode&lt;/code>&lt;/em>&lt;code>.dat&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Move file to &lt;code>/UFL Dropbox/PORTAL_primary_data/Weather/Raw_data/2002_Station&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is a manual rain gauge mounted near the station. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly a tradition at this point, but it is nice to get an in-person look at how much moisture the site got over the last month.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>measure the mm of rain&lt;/li>
&lt;li>dump it out and add new mineral oil&lt;/li>
&lt;li>write the measurement on the rodent datasheet&lt;/li>
&lt;li>enter it into the spreadsheet in Dropbox&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="logistics---you-can-do-it-">Logistics - You Can Do It! :)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Glenda may ask you to do some more complicated maintenance, or you may discover something needs to be done when checking on the station.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you have something complicated to do, don&amp;rsquo;t save it until the last day of your trip. The first thing you try may not work, and you&amp;rsquo;ll need some time for troubleshooting. It can be frustrating and difficult to focus if you need to leave soon to make a flight, or you&amp;rsquo;re tired and ready to be done for the month. It will be much more relaxing if you start the process earlier in the trip. And sometimes the solution will come to you if you just sleep on it!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Resources in the Portal area have fortunately improved in recent years. You may need to find wifi to look up directions, download drivers or software updates, etc. Or you may need to get supplies. It is likely you will be able to do some research or get what you need, and go back to the station to try it out. Trying one thing at a time over multiple trips is a long arduous process. It&amp;rsquo;s better to get it done in one trip.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wifi is available at several locations:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://cochiselibrary.org/client/en_US/portal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Portal Library&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/coronado/recarea/?recid=84324" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cave Creek Visitor Information Center&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.amnh.org/research/southwestern-research-station" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Southwestern Research Station&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://www.thevalleymercantile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valley Mercantile&lt;/a> is a harware store and has electrical equipment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We have a set of electronics screwdrivers, zip and velcro cable ties, a voltmeter, a combination wire tool, and of course a tool box in the truck. All the computer supplies you need for connecting to the equipment (connecting the Surface to the modem, downloading data, etc.) are in the &amp;rsquo;electronics bag&amp;rsquo; in the truck. If there is anything else you find useful, buy it with your P Card (or ask Glenda to buy it) and add it to the kit!&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Read through the field guides and browse the manuals in the Portal Dropbox folder maze. It will feel less daunting if you&amp;rsquo;ve already studied up on what everything is and some basic procedures before something comes up.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Dropbox/Portal/FieldGuides/Weather_Station_Diagram.pptx - a diagram of how everything is connected and how you access it, locally and remotely. Password protected, ask Glenda to share the password with you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dropbox/Portal/FieldGuides/Weather_station_guide.docx - a guide to everything (also password protected), including:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>a description of all the hardware&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a description of all the software&lt;/li>
&lt;li>an explanation of how the network is set up and how to use it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>instructions for common tasks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>how to troubleshoot&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dropbox/Portal/PORTAL_primary_data/Weather/Manuals - browse through these to see what each of the sensors look like. Some will be helpful in troubleshooting, in particular:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Modem-quick-deploy-guide.pdf&lt;/li>
&lt;li>CellularModem.pdf&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PhenoCam_Install_Instructions.pdf&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Loggernet.pdf&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When Glenda is at the site with you, have her give you an in-person tour of the weather station. Then, read through the guides again.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="resources">Resources&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.campbellsci.in/support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Campbell Scientific Support&lt;/a> - this is where you find software downloads, drivers, FAQs, and the Forum.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.campbellsci.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Campbell Scientific User Forum&lt;/a> - if it hasn&amp;rsquo;t come up for us before, it may not be in our guides, but it will likely be in the forum.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="phenocam">Phenocam&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The phenocam is the only piece of equipment on the station &lt;em>not&lt;/em> from Campbell Scientific. It takes a picture every day and uploads it to the &lt;a href="https://phenocam.nau.edu/webcam/sites/portal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phenocam Network&lt;/a>. Those data are publically available and published every few years. They generate cool time series like a &lt;a href="https://phenocam.nau.edu/webcam/browse/portal/2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stitched time series image&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://phenocam.nau.edu/webcam/roi/portal/SH_1000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gcc&lt;/a>. You can also access the live image remotely (instructions in field guide) where you can adjust the settings or focus.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2002-station">2002 station&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This station has been going since 2002 and is very basic. In the 20-teens it gave us a lot of difficulty and seemed like it was on its way out. Which is why we installed the newer fancier one in 2016 (the &amp;lsquo;2016 station&amp;rsquo;). But it hasn&amp;rsquo;t given up the ghost yet. As long as it lasts, we&amp;rsquo;ll keep downloading the data and adding it to the &amp;lsquo;Portal_weather_overlap&amp;rsquo; file, so we have some adjustment between the old and new sensor measurements.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Python - Package Documentation</title><link>http://localhost:1313/docs/computers-and-programming/python-package-documentation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/computers-and-programming/python-package-documentation/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="add-docs">Add docs&lt;/h2>

As a note, these are rights related to your employment status with the university (as opposed to as a student).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A summary of rights based on the previous (2017-2020) version of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is below, the official version of the full current contract is available on &lt;a href="https://www.ufgau.org/cba.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBA page of the GAU website&lt;/a>. In cases where the language is squishy in the contract, an attempt has been made to clarify how the policy will be applied to our group.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="leaves-of-absence-with-pay">Leaves of Absence (with pay)&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If an injury/disability/illness prevents you from conducting your RA/TA duties you cannot be required to do them. But you should notify your supervisor immediately.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you have a family-related issue you cannot be required to perform your RA/TA while you tend to the family emergency
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>family = parents, spouse/domestic partner, sibling,child, legal dependent or relative living with you&lt;/li>
&lt;li>issue = injury/illness/death&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the university is closed for a holiday or emergency (e.g., hurricanes) you get the day off. That day off does not count against you and cannot be taken out of your personal leave time (see below).
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>there are exceptions the first sentence, but are unlikely to apply to our group at this time.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="conferences">Conferences&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Conferences: You have the right to go to conferences/professional development events. The language here is squishy, but seems to indicate that supervisors should not use your TA/RA duties to prevent you from going unless it&amp;rsquo;s super-duper inconvenient.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Application to our group (an example): if you are the Portal RA and you see a conference you want to attend in the reasonably distant future (say before Portal plane tickets are bought) occurs about the time you would be expected to go for a rodent census, then we will work together to either shift the timing of the census or find someone to substitute for you so you can go to the conference. If a couple of days before you are supposed to go down to Portal you find out about a workshop you want to attend that would prevent you from going to that census, we can discuss whether or not we can find a solution but if we can&amp;rsquo;t, I am allowed to say &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m really sorry but because of your RA duties this isn&amp;rsquo;t going to work, let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can get you that training experience another way&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="personal-days">Personal Days&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The contracts guarantees you 5 days per semester to take off without explanation (this is in addition to university holidays).
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: Given our lab philosophy that we are maximally productive and creative when we take time for self maintenance, you should not view 5 days/semester as a maximum limit. 5 days/semester is your right. Sometimes you may need more time and we understand that. If you are worried about balancing responsibilities with your need for extra time, you should feel free to talk with us about a) whether there is a concern (feeling guilty about taking time off and there actually being an issue are two separate things) and b) strategies for managing competing needs if there are legitimate concerns. Remember, if you need extra time due to something that falls under the Leave of Absence policy (above), those days do NOT count as personal days.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="unpaid-leave">Unpaid Leave&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You are entitled to 6 weeks of unpaid leave during any year if you have a new child (through either birth or adoption), to care for immediate family (defined above), or develop a serious health condition and cannot perform your duties.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Translation: what this means is that you can walk away for up to 6 weeks and the university is required to give you the same (or similar) position when you return but you will not be paid during this time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In practice: please, please, please talk to us (Ethan and Morgan). We have a history of working with students/postdocs who have had babies, serious family issues, or developed debilitating diseases during their time with us. Each situation and each mentee&amp;rsquo;s constraints/needs differ. Let us help you strategize what the best path forward is for you.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>While on unpaid leave you will retain your health insurance and (maybe) your tuition waiver. It is unclear when the tuition waiver won&amp;rsquo;t be maintained.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Important: the University policy only applies AFTER your first semester on a RA/TA. If you need unpaid leave during your 1st semester on a RA/TA the university is not constrained by the contract.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In practice: Please talk to Ethan/Morgan if you feel like you need an extended absence from the program during your 1st semester.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="workload">Workload&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You cannot be forced to work more hours than your position requires. This number depends on your FTE (full-time equivalent) appointment.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Most RAs in our group are 0.5 FTE (or half-time). Your specifically required RA duties can&amp;rsquo;t comprise more than 20 hours/week.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How this applies to our lab: The intersection of the RA duties with a student&amp;rsquo;s dissertation/educational plan is where things get muddied, lines get blurred, and where abuses can and do occur. For example, if a student is doing a dissertation chapter that is also a project required for a grant on which they are an RA, and a supervisor pushes a student to work more, is the supervisor requiring the student to put in more hours on the RA or pushing the student to make progress on the dissertation? It is sadly common that supervisors to say it is &amp;ldquo;for the dissertation&amp;rdquo; when in reality the motivation is actually related to the work required for the grant (or the supervisor&amp;rsquo;s own professional needs). This is part of the reason we do annual self-evaluations and have you set your own goals, so it is clearer when feedback is based on your progress on your educational plan vs when what we are asking for is unrelated to that and RA related. Ethan and Morgan know the current system in the lab is imperfect and we are slowly trying to make this aspect clearer and more transparent. For now, if you feel that aspects of what you are doing are not related to your educational plan (defined as dissertation plus professional development) and are taking up more than 20 hours per week then please talk to us, or have someone else in the lab convey that there is concern about this (potentially anonymously) if you are uncomfortable communicating this to us directly so we can sit down and talk through the RA responsibilities, how to decrease the hours associated with them, and make sure you have the time to put towards your own educational goals.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

&lt;li>RA/TAs are required to be paid at least $21,333.33 for a 0.5 FTE 12-month appointment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fees for graduate students are not due until Fall: Nov. 15, Spring: Mar 15, Summer A,B,C: Jul 21st&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The university provides health insurance to all RA/TAs with an FTE &amp;gt;= 0.25 and should be charged only a $10/month. Dependents/Spouses can be added at additional costs.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="discrimination">Discrimination&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>All personnel decisions related to RA/TAs should be based on job performance and job-related criteria and not based on &amp;ldquo;race, color, sex, religious creed, national origin, age, veteran status, disability, political affiliation, sexual orientation, marital status, gender identity, or any other category protected by federal or state law&amp;rdquo;.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The contract makes no mention of what your rights are if this has happened. Sigh. We will develop a page of resources/protocols that are available to you to pursue action.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="work-spaces">Work spaces&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you are required to work on-campus, the university must give you a place to work&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you feel that your working environment is unsafe (in the health and hazard sense) you should report this to an administrator who is required to conduct an investigation. You will be provided the outcome of the investigation and any actions the university needs to take to remedy the situation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The university should give you a 1 month notice if they are going to move your work space&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-process-if-your-supervisor-submits-a-formal-complaint-about-you">What is the process if your supervisor submits a formal complaint about you?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The contract outlines the process and rights of the RA/TA if their supervisor starts formal disciplinary proceedings against them. This process ONLY applies to work-related issues related to the RA/TA. It does not cover other aspects of the graduate student/mentor relationship (e.g., requesting a new PhD mentor or a mentor requesting a student be reassigned to another mentor). This process involves the supervisor submitting a complaint to the university, the university investigating this complaint and deciding on appropriate action and you having a chance to appeal the decision. This situation rarely happens but since it is really important to know your rights if it does, things are broken out and defined below.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="step-1-request-for-disciplinary-action">Step 1: Request for Disciplinary Action&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What is a Disciplinary Action? It is a formal accusation of misconduct/incompetency submitted to the University. It is not an oral reprimand, letters of counseling, or other criticism. A formal Disciplinary Action will be handled through the university and involves due process.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>RA/TAs can only be disciplined for misconduct or incompetency. Actions outside the scope of employment cannot be used against you unless they &amp;ldquo;adversely affect the legitimate and compelling interests of the University&amp;rdquo; (which are undefined)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Accusations of misconduct or incompetency will be investigated by the university and conducted as confidentially as possible. The RA/TA will be notified in writing about the result of the investigation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Disciplinary actions can result in termination of the RA/TA or suspension w/ or w/o pay, depending on the degree of misconduct, or a written formal reprimand.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If terminated, the student will have to pay pro-rated tuition starting at the date of termination.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="step-2-grievance">Step 2: Grievance&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you have concerns about how the university decision was made (for whatever reason) you have the right to request a Grievance Procedure. This is when the union gets involved.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What is a Grievance?: a formal complaint by an employee towards their employer that the employee has been treated unfairly in some way.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Grievance Procedure Grievance is a formal process and will involve the union in some capacity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Representation: during this process you have a right to be represented by a union official, by legal counsel, or to represent yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your supervisor cannot punish you for the time required to participate in grievance meetings (i.e. they cannot withhold pay or deny you time off to attend the meeting.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is a detailed process in the contract for how to proceed with a Grievance. Long story short, contact the UFF-GAU (graduate student union) and let them help you through this process.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="when-can-a-rata-be-terminated">When can a RA/TA be terminated?&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Continued failure to perform duties specified in the letter of appointment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Failure to make appropriate progress towards degree&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Documented misconduct/incompetence (must be on record with the department)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lack of funds as a result of adverse financial conditions (Unclear if this means at the university level or if the grant suddenly turns out to lack money)&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Make sure Git is set up on your computer and in R (ask Ethan for help on this one)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sign into your GitHub account&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click on the plus sign in the top right-hand corner (near your profile picture) and select &amp;ldquo;New repository&amp;rdquo;. You can choose to make your new repo through your account or the Weecology one on the next page.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Name your repository, add a quick description if desired, select Public or Private (most often Public) and &lt;em>be sure to check the box to initialize a README document&lt;/em>. Click &lt;em>Create Repository.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;ll now be on the page for your new repo. Find the green icon &lt;strong>CODE&lt;/strong> that has either an https address or something that looks like an email address (SSH). Make sure that the box to the left of text box says HTTPS rather than SSH. Then click the clipboard icon to the right of the text box. This will copy that address to your clipboard.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now you&amp;rsquo;re done with GitHub. Open up RStudio. Go to &lt;em>File&lt;/em> and select &lt;em>New Project&lt;/em>. If Git is properly set up in RStudio, you should have an option called &lt;em>Version Control&lt;/em>. Click on that option.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Select the &lt;em>Git&lt;/em> option from the next menu.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Paste the HTTPS address into the &lt;em>Repository URL&lt;/em> box. It will auto-fill the &lt;em>Project directory name&lt;/em>. Make sure the project is being created in the appropriate folder.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click &lt;em>Create Project&lt;/em> and voila!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now you should see a &lt;em>Git&lt;/em> tab next to the &lt;em>Environment&lt;/em> and &lt;em>History&lt;/em> tabs. From there, you can make commits, push (green up arrow), and pull (blue down arrow).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>RStudio on Serenity</title><link>http://localhost:1313/docs/computers-and-programming/rstudio-on-serenity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/computers-and-programming/rstudio-on-serenity/</guid><description>&lt;p>We have a lab server which is fairly powerful. It has 32GB of RAM and a 2 core Intel Xeon processor. This is faster and has more ram than any of our laptops. It&amp;rsquo;s good for doing things that may take too long on a desktop/laptop or as a test bed for running on the hipergator.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note you must be on campus to use serenity, or logged in via the VPN.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="using-rstudio">Using RStudio&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Open a browser and go to &lt;a href="http://serenity.ifas.ufl.edu:8787" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://serenity.ifas.ufl.edu:8787&lt;/a> and login with your serenity username and password. Note this will only work when on campus. For off campus access see below.&lt;br>
This runs exactly like RStudio on your desktop. You&amp;rsquo;ll have to re-install any packages that you need.
This works great for code that takes a long time to run. You can start something, then close the browser and Rstudio will keep running on serenity.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="logging-in-from-off-campus">Logging in from off campus&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are two options to login from off campus. The first is to use the UFL VPN. Once connected you can go to the address above. The second is to access it via the hipergator login node using the steps below.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="on-windows">On Windows&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Download the putty ssh client &lt;a href="https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty.exe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Open putty and make a connection to the hipergator login node. Put &lt;code>hpg.rc.ufl.edu&lt;/code> into the Host Name box. Put &lt;code>hipergator&lt;/code> into the Saved Sessions box and click Save to save this setup. Then in the menu go to Connection -&amp;gt; SSH -&amp;gt; Auth -&amp;gt; Tunnels. Put &lt;code>8787&lt;/code> in the source port and &lt;code>serenity.ifas.ufl.edu:8787&lt;/code> in the Destination and click add.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/gEtmuCn.png" alt="" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then in the left side go back to the Session tab and click Save again. Then click open to connect. Enter your username and password. Once connected open a browser and go to http://localhost:8787&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="on-mac-or-linux">On mac or linux&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SSH to the hipergator using the following command&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A password manager keeps track of the various passwords you use for different websites. (And the reason to use a different password for each account, is so that if your password at one place is compromised, it does not affect your other accounts.)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Commonly recommended password managers are &lt;a href="https://www.lastpass.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lastpass&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://1password.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1password&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lastpass has a free option, but will only sync passwords across similar device-types (e.g. between computers, or between smartphones), but not between computer and smartphone. Paid plans for Lastpass start at $2/month.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1password seems to have a nicer interface, but plans start at $2.99/month.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The common usage for password managers is as browser plug-ins that can remember passwords, generate new random passwords, and autofill.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Both Lastpass and 1password have secure notes, which allow you to keep track of answers to security questions, in case you want to generate random responses rather than use the middle school you went to, which anyone can look up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Apple&amp;rsquo;s iCloud Keychain is another option if you have all Apple devices. Here&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3060630/ios/why-not-pick-keychain-instead-of-1password-or-lastpass.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussion&lt;/a> on the differences with third-party password managers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Since your email usually allows you to reset passwords, it can be preferable to NOT put your email password into your password manager, and instead to secure your email with another strong passphrase.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="passphrases">Passphrases&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Because password managers are secured by a single master passphrase (that unlocks all your passwords), it is recommended that you use a strong passphrase.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>One method is to string together random words, possibly with capitalization and special characters added.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rather than use a website for this (who knows if it is truly random or recording the output it gives you), you can use &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/dice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dice and a word list&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>While trying to memorize the passphrase, you might consider having a written copy that you keep somewhere safe.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="two-factor-authentication">Two-Factor Authentication&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Two-factor authentication (commonly 2FA or MFA for multi-factor) means identifying yourself using components from at least two different categories:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>something you know (e.g. a password)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>something you have (e.g. a key or phone)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>something you are (e.g. fingerprints, biometrics)
Thus, if someone else has your password, they still can&amp;rsquo;t access your account without e.g. your phone, too.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Many large sites (e.g. banks, email) with security concerns have 2FA as an option, but it might need to be turned on. For example, here are the instructions for &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/landing/2step/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gmail&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Common implementations are to send a code by email or text when you log in.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Some places also support apps or devices that generate rolling codes (e.g. &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Authenticator&lt;/a>). These generate rolling codes that rotate regularly, for example, every minute. When synced up with a website during 2FA setup, you can also use the rolling code to authenticate.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Hardware tokens are also possible, for example &lt;a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yubikeys&lt;/a>. You will want to check compatibility with services. For instance, the basic U2F key will not work as 2FA for Lastpass, and you also need a paid Lastpass plan.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="misc">Misc.&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>EFF has a &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere" target="_blank" rel="noopener">browser extension&lt;/a> to use encrypted HTTPS when possible.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>EFF also has a &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">browser extension&lt;/a> to block ads from tracking you across websites.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t plug in unknown USB devices to your computer or your USB devices into unknown ports. (&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nuclearpower-cyber-germany/german-nuclear-plant-infected-with-computer-viruses-operator-says-idUSKCN0XN2OS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">e.g. &amp;#x1f631;&lt;/a>:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>As an example, Hypponen said he had recently spoken to a European aircraft maker that said it cleans the cockpits of its planes every week of malware designed for Android phones. The malware spread to the planes only because factory employees were charging their phones with the USB port in the cockpit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because the plane runs a different operating system, nothing would befall it. But it would pass the virus on to other devices that plugged into the charger.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You can use incognito / private mode when browsing to bypass some paywalls (e.g. NYT&amp;rsquo;s 10-article/month limit)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://objective-see.com/products/oversight.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OverSight&lt;/a> comes recommended by some folks as a way to notify about microphone and camera usage on Macs.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>In academia, it is easy to get caught up in the day to day tasks and lose sight of where you are going and why. Every year we (Ethan and Morgan) reassess our scientific and career goals and take stock of what we accomplished that year, what we had hoped to accomplish, and what we need to be doing to reach our goals. This has been enormously useful for us as it helps us to keep our eye on the ball and think strategically about how we are spending our time. We would like to encourage everyone to conduct their own yearly self assessment so that you can evaluate your progress and keep us informed about your career goals so we can help you to reach them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="process">Process&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>How do you go about doing this?&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We recommend including the following components:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>For students/postdocs: When do you think you will be completing this phase of your training? (&lt;em>This puts in perspective how much time you have to complete your tasks to achieve your goals&lt;/em>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What are your long-term career plans? (&lt;em>This helps focus in on what kind of things you should be doing&lt;/em>)? Include at least two possible career paths. (&lt;em>It&amp;rsquo;s good to consider multiple paths, you&amp;rsquo;ll be happier knowing you have multiple options, and it helps us understand what&amp;rsquo;s most important to you&lt;/em>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What parts of your current job do you like and not like and how does this relate to your career plans? (&lt;em>This helps make sure your career plans fit with your interests&lt;/em>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Given your long-term plans, what do you think you need to do to be successful? (&lt;em>These are what we will call your goals&lt;/em>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What did you accomplish this year towards accomplishing your goals?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What are your plans for next year for working towards your goals? (&lt;em>Be as specific as you can be. Are there particular projects you plan to start/finish? Is there specific training or experiences you think you need to succeed in reaching your goals?&lt;/em>)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It should be written down. This gives you a record next year of what you thought you needed to be doing so you can compare what you did with what you wanted to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Share it with us. This is totally voluntary, but we know a little bit about succeeding in academia and we know a lot of people who work in other areas of science (and software engineering). Our goal is to help you be successful in whatever career path you choose. Knowing what you want to do, what you think you need in order to do it, and what you want to accomplish helps us advise you better during your weekly meetings.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In order to facilitate this process we designate one week each year, typically during the Spring Semester, where we will plan to look over your self-assessments and discuss them with you during your weekly meeting. We will give you a few weeks notice on when that week will be and encourage you to send us your self-assessments one week in advance of your meeting so that we have time to look it over and think about it. If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to participate, just let us know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, a note for more permanent staff: we think you&amp;rsquo;re awesome, and we&amp;rsquo;d love for you to stick around forever, but we know that you may have bigger plans, and you know that these kinds of positions are always dependent on sufficient funding being maintained in the labs. We want you to get where you want to go, so you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t worry about sharing goals with us that involve you leaving at some point. Of course it&amp;rsquo;s totally understandable if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to tell us about this (or if you never want to leave), but just know that we&amp;rsquo;ll be supportive of whatever you&amp;rsquo;re trying to do.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Slack</title><link>http://localhost:1313/docs/lab-policy-procedures/slack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/lab-policy-procedures/slack/</guid><description>&lt;p>Slack is Weecology&amp;rsquo;s internal communication system. Think of it as an email/texting hybrid. It plays a vital role in our group by keeping team members informed of each other&amp;rsquo;s activities, allowing weecologists to see what other groups are doing, and to leverage our breadth of knowledge and expertise to help each other. Information on specifics of how to use Slack can be found by reading &lt;a href="https://slack.com/resources/slack-101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slack 101&lt;/a> to learn slack basics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Weecology specific information and Slack etiquette tips, read on!&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Slack is official communication. This means it is subject to both the &lt;a href="http://localhost:1313/docs/lab-policy-procedures/code-of-conduct/">Lab Code of Conduct&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="https://ufcn.urel.ufl.edu/email/email.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of Florida Sunshine Laws&lt;/a>. Fun things can still happen on here (like the Hao-needs-a-dog channel), just remember that this is still offically Weecology space, just like being physically in the lab.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You may join any Weecology channel even if you are not part of that group. Want to know a little more about what the forecasting group is doing? Or Everglades? It is 100% fine to subscribe and listen in.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Maybe don&amp;rsquo;t subscribe to all of them, though. Information overload can make it hard to winnow signal from noise. Even Ethan and Morgan don&amp;rsquo;t subscribe to all the channels.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can direct message (DM) anyone in the lab if you have things to chat with that are only relevant to that person. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to do all communication through a channel. DM&amp;rsquo;ing can especially be a good way to contact Ethan and Morgan, to circumvent their full email inboxes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If someone posts something in slack that you want to discuss further, use the &lt;a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-in/help/articles/115000769927-Use-threads-to-organise-discussions-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reply function&lt;/a>. 14 back and forths about how cute a rodent is (which is totally an ok discussion to have!) can clutter a channel but the reply function lets you have that discussion, tied directly to that cute pic, while not cluttering the main flow of discussion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you mistakenly forget to reply and send something that should have been a reply more broadly, it&amp;rsquo;s ok. No one will get mad. These are just guidelines.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using mentions (@NAME) is a good way to let people know that something is being discussed that requires their attention. For example: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m still waiting for feedback from @morgan&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></description></item><item><title>Social Events</title><link>http://localhost:1313/docs/lab-policy-procedures/social-events/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/lab-policy-procedures/social-events/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few times each year the lab will get together for social events outside of normal work hours. Most frequently these events involve dinner at Ethan and Morgan&amp;rsquo;s house and group dinners at conferences.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>These events are completely voluntary and are not important for your professional development as a weecologist.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Significant others, children, and service animals are welcome.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The lab code of conduct applies to these events.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Morgan and Ethan will take care of food and drinks. If you have any dietary requirements please let them know.&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="contributor-code-of-conduct">Contributor Code of Conduct&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="our-pledge">Our Pledge&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="our-standards">Our Standards&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Using welcoming and inclusive language&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Focusing on what is best for the community&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Showing empathy towards other community members&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Public or private harassment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Publishing others&amp;rsquo; private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="our-responsibilities">Our Responsibilities&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="scope">Scope&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="enforcement">Enforcement&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at &lt;a href="mailto:ethan@weecology.org">ethan@weecology.org&lt;/a>. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project&amp;rsquo;s leadership.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>SSH (short for &amp;ldquo;secure shell&amp;rdquo;) is a computer protocol for encrypting access to computers over a network. Typical use cases are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>accessing HiPerGator and Serenity servers from a laptop or desktop machine, while on the UF network&lt;/li>
&lt;li>cloning, pulling, or pushing to GitHub repositories&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-software-do-i-need">What software do I need?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>SSH should be pre-installed with Mac OS, Windows 10, and Linux.
On other versions of Windows, you might want to download
which also contains some other useful tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-an-ssh-key">What is an SSH key?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Access to servers through SSH involves authenticating yourself with a username and password (the same as if you were logging in directly to the machine).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Alternatively, you can generate a digital &amp;ldquo;key&amp;rdquo; that provides access to the keyholder. Typically, you generate an SSH key for your computer, and then set up the appropriate file on the server(s) you wish to access. Then, instead of authenticating yourself with your username and password for the server, you instead use the SSH key, which is verified by the paired file previously copied to the server. (You can also provide a passphrase in order to use your SSH key, but as it&amp;rsquo;s stored on your laptop or desktop and requires you to be logged in, this security step is optional - opinions vary on this.)&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setup-instructions-github">Setup Instructions (GitHub)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>GitHub has fairly detailed
on creating a new SSH key;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and further
to enable it for use on Github.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setup-instructions-serenity--hipergator--generic">Setup Instructions (Serenity / HiPerGator / generic)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To setup an SSH key for use on Serenity, we assume you have gone through the steps described in the instructions for GitHub to create an SSH key. This creates both the key itself (usually located in &lt;code>~/.ssh/id_rsa&lt;/code>), and a paired file that verifies that the key is correct (usually located in &lt;code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub&lt;/code>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>If you are setting up an SSH key on HiPerGator, note that you probably already have one in the default location, which is used for communicating between different HiPerGator nodes. You may only need to follow the
to enable its usage for github, as well.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Log in to the server you wish to use the SSH key on.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Edit the &lt;code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/code> file &lt;em>on the server&lt;/em>. It may already have contents, in which case, go to a new, blank line.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Copy over the contents of the &lt;code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub&lt;/code> from your local computer. It will look something like:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">ssh-rsa *************long-string of random characters************* &amp;lt;email address&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>&lt;strong>(If you see something like: &lt;code>-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----&lt;/code>, you are using the wrong file!!)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>Save the modified &lt;code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/code> file on the server.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Try to connect using ssh. In the command line on your local computer:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">ssh &amp;lt;username&amp;gt;@&amp;lt;server&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>You should authenticate without having to enter your password.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Teaching Opportunities</title><link>http://localhost:1313/docs/lab-policy-procedures/teaching-opportunities/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/lab-policy-procedures/teaching-opportunities/</guid><description>&lt;p>Teaching opportunities are available for folks in the group who want to develop teaching skills and experience or just like to teach others.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>UF has an active Carpentries community originally co-founded by weecologists.
There is typically a Carpentries Instructor Training workshop each year to receive training in how to teach workshops.
One you&amp;rsquo;ve completed this training there are multiple workshops per year at UF to teach in.
Find out more at the &lt;a href="https://www.uf-carpentries.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UF Carpentries Club site&lt;/a>.
Weecology will cover any costs associated with training.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="guest-lectures">Guest Lectures&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Guest lectures are when someone delivers one or more lectures in someone else&amp;rsquo;s course.
Ethan and Morgan are happy to support members of the group teaching guest lectures in their courses and there are sometimes opportunities for guest lecturing in other courses.
Just let Ethan or Morgan know that you are interested in this and they will work with you to identify the best opportunities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="co-teaching-as-instructor-of-record">Co-teaching as instructor of record&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The best way to understand what developing and teaching courses is like is to co-teach a course.
This is also useful for demonstrating real experience and committment to teaching for people interested in going into teaching focused careers.
Morgan and Ethan are both willing to co-teach courses with folks who want to do this and have sufficient time and energy to do so.
You will actually be an official instructor (also known as an &amp;ldquo;instructor of record&amp;rdquo;) and we will work with you to learn how to teach and develop new course materials for college courses.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ufsanta-fe-college-faculty-development-project">UF/Santa Fe College Faculty Development Project&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The UF/Santa Fe College Faculty Development Project is a partnership between the University of Florida and local Santa Fe College that aims to increase faculty diversity at Santa Fe College while providing doctoral students at UF with valuable teaching experience. Participants teach two courses per year at SFC and assist in its recruitment and retention of minority and underrepresented students. The program provides a stipend of $15,000 for nine months, in-state tuition, fees, and health insurance for fall-spring semesters with an additional amount supplied by UF.

&lt;h3 id="in-town">In town&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Natural History Museum / Butterfly Rainforest&lt;br>
Entrance to the museum is free, you only have to pay for the Butterflies or temporary exhibits. Butterfly Rainforest fee is $13/6 for adults/kids. Current UFL students get in for free.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Paynes Prairie State Park&lt;br>
La Chua trail on the East side of town is where the large alligators are. Lake access, trails, and a lookout tower are on the West side. Bison are usually on the West side.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Devil&amp;rsquo;s Millhopper State Park&lt;br>
Large sink hole with 200 step staircase going down into it. A short nature trail surrounding it. Worth seeing but probably not for more than an hour or so.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sweetwater Wetlands Park&lt;br>
Man-made wetland with boardwalk nature trails. Scarcely-shaded so ideal to visit early in the morning or late in the afternoon.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="outside-of-town">Outside of town&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>St. Augustine.&lt;br>
A nice beach, historic fort &amp;amp; downtown.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Springs&lt;br>
Numerous springs around Gainesville worth a visit. Most are state parks and have an entrance fee. See a map &lt;a href="http://www.floridasprings.org/visit/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="food">Food&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>East End Eatery - Great breakfast, closes after lunchtime.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Satchel&amp;rsquo;s Pizza - local institution. good pizza. serves beer and house-made sodas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Top - Good food all around, large beer collection&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Boca Fiesta - Good mexican food&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La Tienda - &lt;strong>Really&lt;/strong> good mexican food.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sweetberries - Great sandwiches and ice cream, close to campus.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mi Apa Latin Cafe - &lt;strong>Really&lt;/strong> good Cuban food&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Baker Baker - excellent bakert and very reasonably priced. Runs out early, so if it&amp;rsquo;s 10 am you are WAY too late.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="bike-shops">Bike Shops&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Reitz Union has a student bike repair shop &amp;ndash; services (basic?) are &lt;a href="https://www.sg.ufl.edu/BikeRepair" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Joan recommends Bikes &amp;amp; More on NW 6th St.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gator Cycle on Archer Road seems good, too (Hao is getting his wheels trued there)&lt;/li>

Prefer rough answers to the right questions over precise answers to the wrong ones&lt;br>
There is no one &amp;ldquo;right way&amp;rdquo; to do science, not even your way&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Prioritize science over credit, but credit everyone who contributes&lt;br>
Recognize and credit all aspects of the scientific process&lt;br>
Don&amp;rsquo;t be territorial, there is too much work to do to fight over who does what&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Train the next generation of scientists, and the previous one&lt;br>
Help make science more diverse and inclusive&lt;br>
Be generous&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Treat other scientists like you would want to be treated&lt;br>
When you screw up, and you will, apologize and do better&lt;br>
Don&amp;rsquo;t punch down&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Talkin&amp;rsquo; ain&amp;rsquo;t doin&amp;rsquo;&lt;br>
Remember that saying No is just saying Yes to something else&lt;br>
Choose the path that advances knowledge as quickly as possible&lt;br>
That often means stopping the ideal from being the enemy of the good&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good science comes from happy people&lt;br>
Work in the way that works best for you&lt;br>
Take care of yourself and those around you&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Open is better than closed&lt;br>
Share knowledge and tools broadly&lt;br>
But recognize that not everything should be open&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are many versions of success&lt;br>
You define success for yourself&lt;br>
Your priorities, strengths, and goals will help you find your path&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s all going to be OK&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>WEC Staff</title><link>http://localhost:1313/docs/uf-bureaucracy/wec-staff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/uf-bureaucracy/wec-staff/</guid><description>&lt;p>If something seems is going wrong, especially if you have some scary warnings holding on your tuition and fees status, this is the page for you!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t worry (too much), since that&amp;rsquo;s something more common than expected. However, you may need to contact &lt;strong>Daniel Deep&lt;/strong> at &lt;a href="mailto:ganderindan@ufl.edu">ganderindan@ufl.edu&lt;/a>. He is a great guy, and will try to fix your issues in no time!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-if-i-am-getting-worried-about-travel-reimbursement">What if I am getting worried about travel reimbursement?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Take into consideration that tons of folks are traveling too, and hence delays are normal. The rule of a thumb in this case is to send a reminder email to &lt;strong>WECfiscal&lt;/strong> (&lt;a href="mailto:WECFiscal@ifas.ufl.edu">WECFiscal@ifas.ufl.edu&lt;/a>) a month or so after you sent them your Travel Expense Report. If you don&amp;rsquo;t receive any answer yet, send another email after two weeks, this time CCing your adviser. Another good advice in this space is to get in touch with &lt;strong>Donna Dyer&lt;/strong> (&lt;a href="mailto:dkb@ufl.edu">dkb@ufl.edu&lt;/a>). She Has been working here for 30 years, is well prepared, and always useful. Ideally, if you are in office, you better go and talk to her in person: that will solve your problems way faster!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Who We Are</title><link>http://localhost:1313/docs/collaborating-with-us/how-to-work-with-us/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/collaborating-with-us/how-to-work-with-us/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="who-we-are">Who We Are&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>In our workflows with deal with complex input-output structures, like having early phases of the pipeline work on one flight (file) at a time and later phases work on all of the files from a given site and year as a group.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This can be accomplished by defining custom input functions.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="testing-snakemake-with-partial-wildcards">Testing snakemake with partial wildcards&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When testing big workflow it is often useful to run the workflow on a subset of the data.
For example our Everglades workflow runs on all years, sites, and flight at once, but we might want to test a site year-site combination when making a change.
To prepare to do this replace your Wildcards object with the component lists for the main workflow. E.g.,&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="n">ORTHOMOSAICS&lt;/span> &lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">glob_wildcards&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s2">&amp;#34;/&lt;/span>&lt;span class="si">{year}&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s2">/&lt;/span>&lt;span class="si">{site}&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s2">/&lt;/span>&lt;span class="si">{flight}&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s2">.tif&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">)&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="n">FLIGHTS&lt;/span> &lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">ORTHOMOSAICS&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">.&lt;/span>&lt;span class="n">flight&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="n">SITES&lt;/span> &lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">ORTHOMOSAICS&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">.&lt;/span>&lt;span class="n">site&lt;/span>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The components are just lists, so you can then replace them with whatever pieces of the full workflow you want to test. E.g.,:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="n">ORTHOMOSAICS&lt;/span> &lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">glob_wildcards&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s2">&amp;#34;/&lt;/span>&lt;span class="si">{year}&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s2">/&lt;/span>&lt;span class="si">{site}&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s2">/&lt;/span>&lt;span class="si">{flight}&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s2">.tif&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">)&lt;/span>

&lt;h2 id="alternate-work-location-agreement">Alternate Work Location Agreement&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For folks working off campus for extended periods we need to let UF know that you are planning to work offcampus as your official work location. Download the &lt;a href="https://hr.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Remote-Work-Location-Agreement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alternate WorkLocation Agreement&lt;/a> and fill out as much as you can. If something does not seem relevant to you, put in N/A. Send to your supervisor (Morgan or Ethan) to fill out or discuss anything that you can&amp;rsquo;t answer on your own. When the two of you are happy with the form, your supervisor will send it to the WEC staff to be submitted to UF. You will be asked to sign the document through docusign, so signing it in advance is not necessary. The form needs to be renewed every year.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Setting up a new Windows computer under the UF domain remotely is not possible. It will give you an error message that your Microsoft account does not exist, if you try to use your UF GatorLink log-ins. However, creating a local account can be done.&lt;/p>
