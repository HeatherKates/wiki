## How to Use

If you are a new member to the lab, please see the [issues](https://github.com/weecology/lab-wiki/issues) page of the lab wiki for the onboarding checklist. Make a new issue with your name and copy the list, and then be sure to go through it, referring back to the info here as necessary.

# General Lab Policies

## Calendars

Once you have your weecology.org Google account, you will have access to the lab calendars. You can access these from a web browser at [https://calendar.google.com/](https://calendar.google.com/). (**Note that you may need to use the account management button in the upper-right corner if you are logged in with other Google accounts at the same time.**)

Please keep your personal calendar up to date on when you will be out of town to help with scheduling meetings. Ethan & Morgan will have viewing access to your calendar. Some calendars you might want to add to your view to stay informed are:
* "ethan" (Ethan White)
* "morgan" (Morgan Ernest)
* "conference room"

The conference room schedule is maintained separately. You might need to contact someone who already has access to share the calendar with you.

## Lab Meeting

(for Spring 2018) Weds at 1pm ET.

Typical agenda is something like:
* general announcements
* short summary of past week from individuals present
* presentation of research (see [here](https://github.com/weecology/lab-wiki/wiki/Lab-Meeting) for the schedule)

# Day-to-Day Operations

## Computer Setup

Tell Glenda if you need a new computer.

Here's a basic checklist for computer privacy and security. For more info, check out the wiki page on [Computer Security and Privacy Resources](https://github.com/weecology/lab-wiki/wiki/Computer-Security-&-Privacy-Resources)

- [ ] Get a password manager for your various website passwords.
- [ ] Set up 2FA where you can, and especially for important services like email and GitHub
- [ ] ^ Talk to Ethan or Glenda about getting a Yubikey for 2FA if you don't have one already
- [ ] Set up a SSH key for command-line access to GitHub. [instructions here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-ssh/)

### Basic Software Setup

[Programming setup for Macs](https://github.com/weecology/lab-wiki/wiki/Computer-Setup-for-Mac)

***TODO: Complete existing page***

***TODO: Info for other OSes***

The lab is transitioning to use of [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) as a common standard for managing bibliographies.

### Programming

* Style Guidelines

(Hao) I have this in my `~/.gitconfig` file to enable the `git lg` alias on command-line.
```
[alias]
lg1 = log --graph --abbrev-commit --decorate --format=format:'%C(bold blue)%h%C(reset) - %C(bold green)(%ar)%C(reset) %C(white)%<(40,trunc)%s%C(reset) %C(reverse white)- %an%C(reset)%C(bold yellow)%d%C(reset)' --all

### Backup

Offsite backup of lab computers is best done using the *T: drive*. [Access instructions](https://github.com/weecology/lab-wiki/wiki/Accessing-the-T:-drive)

***TODO: Info on how to setup automated backups? ***

### Lab Printer

The lab printer is located in room 015 and accessible from the UFL network at `10.242.89.254`. You may need to [download and install drivers](http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/product-support/product/dell-c3760dn/drivers) before adding it as a printer in order for it to function properly.
