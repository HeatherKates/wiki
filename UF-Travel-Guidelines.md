#Basic Travel Info

*Do I need to read this?
       * If your traveling being paid for by UF (either Morgan, Ethan, or some other source)?
            *Yes? Then read on.
            *No? Coordinate with whomever is paying your travel.

The travel reimbursement process at UF can be broken down into 2 major steps: 1) Approval of pending travel (TAR), 2) Being reimbursed for travel (TER)
 
## Travel Authorization (TAR):

Before you start the travel authorization process, make sure you know how your trip is being paid. There are two ways things can be paid: 1) by you and then reimbursed after the trip, 2) by a pcard (this is a credit card linked to a grant or other UF account). Pcards can be used to pay for hotels, airfare, gas for rentals and state vehicles, and conference registration.

**Step 1**. Do you (or the person who is traveling) already have a UFID#?

    Yes. Proceed to step 2
    No. Send the following info about the traveler to Caprice McRae (mcraec@ufl.edu) and ask for a UFID to be assigned:
        Full Name of Traveler (including middle name)
        Home Address
        Email Address
        Date of Birth
        Last 4 digits of Social Security Number 

**Step 2**.  Is a pcard being used to pay for anything for your trip?

    Yes. This will influence how you fill out the TA form
    No. This will also influence how you fill out the TA form
    I don't know. Then go ask whomever is paying for your trip if they can use a pcard to pay for expenses so it doesn't come out of your meager earnings. 

**Step 3**. Download a TA form: http://www.wec.ufl.edu/resources/travel/Travel%20Authorization%201.2.pdf

**Step 4**. Fill out the TA form. Most of the form is self-explanatory. If a pcard is paying for certain things, put that in the pcard column, otherwise, list it under paid by traveler. There are complexities with the form. These are:

    Project #. You will need to get this from the UF entity paying for the trip (i.e. Ethan, Morgan, Department, SNRE, etc)
    Registration: See the Conference travel page for tips on what you need to submit with the TA to document the registration costs.
    International Travel: See the International travel page for what needs to be submitted with your TA.

**Step 5**: Email your completed TA and any required attachments (registration documentation etc) to: WECFiscal@ifas.ufl.edu

Do you need to sign the form? No. Your email is considered your "signature".
