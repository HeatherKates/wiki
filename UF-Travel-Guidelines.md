# Basic Travel Info

_Do I need to read this?_

Is your traveling being paid for by UF (either Morgan, Ethan, or some other source)?

**Yes?** Then read on. If you traveling to go to a conference paid for by UF, skip down to the "Travel to Conferences" section.

**No?** Coordinate with whomever is paying your travel.


The travel reimbursement process at UF can be broken down into 2 major steps: 1) Approval of pending travel (TAR), 2) Being reimbursed for travel (TER)
 
## Travel Authorization (TAR):

Before you start the travel authorization process, make sure you know how your trip is being paid. There are two ways things can be paid: 1) by you and then reimbursed after the trip, 2) by a pcard (this is a credit card linked to a grant or other UF account). Pcards can be used to pay for hotels, airfare, gas for rentals and state vehicles, and conference registration.

**Step 1**. Do you (or the person who is traveling) already have a UFID#?

    Yes. Proceed to step 2
    No. Send the following info about the traveler to Amelia Baiden (amelia05@ufl.edu) and ask for a UFID to be assigned:
        Full Name of Traveler (including middle name)
        Home Address
        Email Address
        Date of Birth
        Last 4 digits of Social Security Number 

**Step 2**.  Is a pcard being used to pay for anything for your trip?

    Yes. This will influence how you fill out the TA form
    No. This will also influence how you fill out the TA form
    I don't know. Then go ask whomever is paying for your trip if they can use a pcard to pay for expenses so it doesn't come out of your meager earnings. 

**Step 3**. Download a TA form: http://www.wec.ufl.edu/resources/travel/Travel%20Authorization%201.2.pdf

**Step 4**. Fill out the TA form. Most of the form is self-explanatory. If a pcard is paying for certain things, put that in the pcard column, otherwise, list it under paid by traveler. There are complexities with the form. These are:

    Project #. You will need to get this from the UF entity paying for the trip (i.e. Ethan, Morgan, Department, SNRE, etc)
    Registration: See the Conference travel page for tips on what you need to submit with the TA to document the registration costs.
    International Travel: See the International travel page for what needs to be submitted with your TA.

**Step 5**: Email your completed TA and any required attachments (registration documentation etc) to: WECFiscal@ifas.ufl.edu

Do you need to sign the form? No. Your email is considered your "signature".

## Travel Expense Report (TER):

You will need to submit a travel expense report after travel is completed. The process will be roughly the same for any type of travel. If you received any travel grants, however, get in touch with the WEC fiscal office for how to address that.

**Step 6**: Submit a [WEC Travel expense report](http://www.wec.ufl.edu/resources/travel/Travel%20Expense%20Report%201.2.pdf)  
    Email it to WECFiscal@ifas.ufl.edu

**Step 7**: Confirm Travel Expense Report is in the system  
    Login to my.ufl.edu and click on Main Menu -> My Self Service -> Travel and Expenses -> Expense Reports -> View  
    Leave everything blank and click Search to view all expense reports.

**Step 8**: Print the travel expense report signature page from my.ufl.edu (or the one emailed to you) and email signed version to WECFiscal@ifas.ufl.edu  
    On the page for the expense report click View Printable Version -> Print Expense Report  
    Current consensus is it only needs the Employee Signature


## Traveling to Conferences

So, you're going to a conference? Conferences have slightly different rules because of registration costs.
Official UF language at end of page

**Step 0**: You will need to submit a TA BEFORE you spend funds.
          This is only true for conferences/workshops.
          Proceed to step 1
 
**Step 1**: Does your conference have registration costs?
          If yes, proceed to 2.
          If no, stop and go to Basic Travel Reimbursement

**Step 2**: Are you getting registration reimbursed?
         If yes, proceed to 3.
         If no, stop and go to Basic Travel Reimbursement

**Step 3**: Get Registration Documentation.    
UF needs to know if meals and housing are included in registration costs so they know they are not double reimbursing you for meals. (Yes, you still need to do this step if you are not planning on getting reimbursed for meals, because: bureaucracy). What they say they want: (from Fiona in WEC's office): Travel now requires that you attach a breakdown of the conference registration fee.  This is meant to show that there are no meals/social events/lodging included in the fee that we might inadvertently pay for.
    I've attached examples of what they will accept. Note, both of these files were sent as the documentation for the 2015 ESA meeting
* [Registartion form]( https://github.com/weecology/lab-wiki/blob/master/2015-ESA-Annual-Mtg-Reg-Form-04-06-15.pdf)
* [Statement from website about what was included in registration](https://github.com/weecology/lab-wiki/blob/master/ESA_registrationcoverage.pdf)


**Step 4**. Submit Travel Authorization
    When you send in your TA form, attach the registration documentation as well to the email

**Step 5**. Once you've completed your travel, complete a Travel Expense Report as detailed above

### Some notes about traveling to conferences:

[UF Documentation on PCARDS and Registration](http://www.purchasing.ufl.edu/departments/pcard/transactions/default.asp)
The PCard can only be used to pay registration fees for conferences, conventions, or seminars.

The PCard may be used when the registration fee includes meals or social events.  Optional events, those with separate fees, cannot be paid via PCard.  Optional events must be paid for by the traveler.

Because conference fees are typically paid in advance the cardholder must sign the registration confirmation to affirm the event is for official business.

Travel Authorizations, required for all travel relating to conferences/conventions, must be done BEFORE making charges.  The Travel Authorization number must be written on the payment documentation.

Please refer to UF's Travel Directives and Procedures for additional information.

Share Registration Documentation. Be kind and share with your labmates. Email the documentation to the lab list or share on Slack.

## Personal Travel Before or After UF-related Travel

You are welcome to add some personal travel to a UF-related work trip. You will just need to submit a cost comparison and will be required to pay for the difference if your chosen travel ends up costing more than it would have if you had not taken a personal trip.

If you are flying, there are a couple ways you can deal with that.
1) Have UF pay for the first and the final leg of travel -or-
2) Have UF pay for the flights to and from the location of your business travel

To submit a cost comparison, what I (Ellen) have done in the past is screenshot a cost breakdown of the flight you would have taken if you had not included any personal travel. This can either be for the day you *would* have flown in/out or the same day you are actually flying, all from the location you would have been flying to/from if personal travel was not included. Do your best to include the date of "alternative" flight, itinerary (AKA cities of origin and destination), and cost-breakdown. It can be helpful to also include the date you are looking at said flights. You will probably also have to include an explanation of why you're flying to/from a different airport, if that is something you're doing.  

I *think* you might still have to submit a cost comparison for flights/travel even if your destination/origin don't change (aka you stay in New Orleans for a couple extra days after ESA but still fly out of the NOLA airport back to Gainesville), but I'm not entirely sure about that, to be honest. 

Feel free to ask Ellen any questions you might have about this process, or you can contact Kevin Geisler (k.geisler@ufl.edu), the new WEC fiscal assistant.

Any issues or questions with the steps above can be resolved by asking [Kevin Geisler](k.geisler@ufl.edu)

* You can only get reimbursed for tipping taxi/Uber/Lyft drivers up to 20%.
