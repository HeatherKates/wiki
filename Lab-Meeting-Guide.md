## Lab Meeting Purpose

Lab meeting is designed to give Weecology members opportunities to practice skills with and/or gain feedback from the broader research group. 

## Lab Meeting Organization 

To make these meetings maximally useful to the person leading it, and give the group clarity on their role during the lab meeting, Ethan and Morgan have created different lab meeting types that have guidelines for how the leader should prepare beforehand and what role the group should focus on playing during lab meeting. Each semester, Morgan and Ethan will think about the overall state of the group and how we would like to focus the lab meeting slots for that semester. People can select dates and trade dates, but because we have a plan for the order of slots, lab meeting types cannot be moved from their assigned dates without approval from Ethan and Morgan. 

## Lab Meeting Types (Alphabetical)

* **Inspire Sessions**:
    * Purpose: To communicate across the lab about research projects currently underway in the form of 5 minute lightning talks. The goal of these lab sessions is to help the group better understand what people are working on so that synergies among projects or researchers can be identified.
    * Leader Responsibilities: All or some subset of the lab will be tasked with giving a 5-minute talk during an Inspire Session. Every speaker is expected to give a 5 minute talk (and no longer!) on one of their projects that abides by the ESA Inspire guidelines. 
    * Group Duties: Enjoy and think about what projects have in common and what skills discussed in the talks might be useful for other projects in the lab.

* **Mini-Lessons**:
    * Purpose: To promote skill and information transfer within the group and provide in-house teaching opportunities.
    * Leader Responsibilities: Good teaching takes advance planning. Make sure to take time to think about the current skill levels within the group and design a lesson plan that will convey your information/skills to the broader group. In a teaching context it is especially important to assess one's use of jargon as this will often create more barriers to learning than it helps overcome. Do not try to cram everything into one presentation. Rushing at the end is not knowledge transfer. As with a talk, Ethan and Morgan often practice lessons before teaching them in class and recommend the leader of a mini-lesson does the same. If the group needs laptops, make sure to communicate this before the day of lab meeting (i.e. not the day of the lab meeting).
    * Group Duties: Ask questions if confused. This serves the dual purpose of helping group members learn (others are probably also confused) and helps the leader understand where there are issues with their lesson plan that can be improved in the future.

* **Practice Talk**: 
    * Purpose: To get feedback on the organization, flow, and clarity of a talk that is going to be presented for a conference, job seminar, defense, etc. 
    * Leader Responsibilities: The leader of a practice talk is wanting an opportunity to run through a talk they are planning to give in the not too distant future for a specific purpose. At this stage, the leader should be looking for feedback on whether their talk effectively communicates or if the audience is getting lost. To do this effectively, the talk needs to be a complete draft. Rough drafts that include things like 'placeholder' slides whereas general description of what one might talk about is stated (i.e. 'I'm thinking of talking about X here') will not obtain focused, concrete, and useful feedback from the group and will leave the group uncertain of what feedback is being solicited.
    * Group Duties: The presenter is looking to improve their talk, so feedback should be focused on improving the presentation for audience comprehension (i.e. are slides legible? Graphics clear? Order of idea presentation has a logical flow, etc). If you have scientific critiques and or suggestions for new analyses, please hold these comments until after lab meeting to avoid distracting from the goal of this session.

* **Problem-Solving Sessions**:
    * Purpose: To get feedback on the lab to help problem-solve issues that are limiting progress. This could be getting feedback on statistical approaches, data collection issues, interpretation of results, computational challenges, or other activities.
    * Leader Responsibilities: The leader of a brainstorming session will need to prepare a presentation to help the group focus on the issue that the leader needs feedback on. This requires enough background and context for the group to understand both what the leader wants from the group and for the group to understand the scope of the problem at hand. The presentation does not need to be polished but it should be polished enough not to be distracting. The presentation should also be focused and no longer than 15 minutes (5 minutes of background, 5 minutes explaining the problem, 1-3 explicit questions - i.e., not 'what do you think?' - that you are asking the group). This may seem like too short to go over everything, but the group will engage better, and brainstorm better with you, through question and answer. 
   * Group Duties: Because the presentation for a brainstorm is necessarily shorter and less polished, comments should not focus on the style of the presentation, but the content. The group should remember that the goal of a brainstorming session is problem solving with in-progress work and should adjust expectations (and feedback) to the stage the work is in.

* **Research Process Discussions**
    * Purpose: To provide an opportunity for the group to informally discuss issues related to 'the job of science' (i.e. career planning, grants, publishing, mentoring, etc).
    * Leader Responsibilities: These sessions will generally be 'led' by Morgan and Ethan who will choose topics depending on perceived needs of the group in general. Leaders of Process Discussions will make sure the lab is notified in advance of lab meeting so the group can come prepared with questions.
    * Group Duties: Group members should think beforehand about their questions, issues, concerns about the topic and come prepared to actively engage to make sure they get what they need out of the discussion. While Ethan and MOrgan will pick topics, weecologists are encouraged to add suggestions for topics at the bottom of the semester's lab meeting page

* **Sprints**: 
    * Purpose: To obtain help from the group to accomplish a task (i.e. data entry, software testing)
    * Leader Responsibilities: Leaders need to be organized beforehand with a plan for what exactly do they want to accomplish, how they will organize the group to do this, and their plan for how much information needs to be conveyed to the group about what they are doing so they can do their tasks effectively and efficiently. The more organized the leader is, the more effective a sprint will be and the more positive the experience will be for everyone.
    * Group Duties: The group in this context is working to help the leader attain some goal. It doesn't help the leader if tasks are being done incorrectly, so it is your responsibility to ask questions if you are unclear on what is expected or if you run into a situation not covered by the leader in the sprint briefing.

* **Talk Training**
    * Purpose: To provide more structure training activities related to designing and presenting a good talk.
    * Leader Responsibilities: To design material/activities that will help the group with structuring and designing talks and give them opportunities to practice.
    * Group Duties: Feedback on any practice activities should focus on talk structure and design and not content, unless content issues are causing clarity problems (i.e. don't get distracted by issues with someone's statistics or experimental design).

* **Team Building Activities**:
    * Purpose: Activities to help break down barriers in the group and promote interactions.
    * Leader Responsibilities: These activities will be organized by Ethan or Morgan, but all weecologists are welcome to make suggestions for group activities.
    * Group Duties: Try to interact with members of the lab that you do not regularly work with.
