## Lab Meeting Purpose

Lab meeting is designed to give Weecology members opportunities to practice skills with and/or gain feedback from the broader research group. 

## Lab Meeting Organization 

To make these meetings maximally useful to the person leading it, and give the group clarity on their role during the lab meeting, Ethan and Morgan have created different lab meeting types that have guidelines for how the leader should prepare beforehand and what role the group should focus on playing during lab meeting. Each semester, Morgan and Ethan will think about the overall state of the group and how we would like to focus the lab meeting slots for that semester. People can select dates and trade dates, but because we have a plan for the order of slots, lab meeting types cannot be moved from their assigned dates without approval from Ethan and Morgan. 

## Lab Meeting Types

* **Practice Talk**: 
    * Purpose: To get feedback on the organization, flow, and clarity of a talk that is going to be presented for a conference, job seminar, defense, etc. 
    * Leader Responsibilities: The leader of a practice talk is wanting an opportunity to run through a talk they are planning to give in the not too distant future for a specific purpose. At this stage, the leader should be looking for feedback on whether their talk effectively communicates or if the audience is getting lost. To do this effectively, the talk needs to be a complete draft. Rough drafts that include things like 'placeholder' slides whereas general description of what one might talk about is stated (i.e. 'I'm thinking of talking about X here') will not obtain focused, concrete, and useful feedback from the group and will leave the group uncertain of what feedback is being solicited.
    * Group Duties: The presenter is looking to improve their talk, so feedback should be focused on improving the presentation for audience comprehension (i.e. are slides legible? Graphics clear? Order of idea presentation has a logical flow, etc). If you have scientific critiques and or suggestions for new analyses, please hold these comments until after lab meeting to avoid distracting from the goal of this session.

* **Sprints**: 
    * Purpose: To obtain help from the group to accomplish a task (i.e. data entry, software testing)
    * Leader Responsibilities: Leaders need to be organized beforehand with a plan for what exactly do they want to accomplish, how they will organize the group to do this, and their plan for how much information needs to be conveyed to the group about what they are doing so they can do their tasks effectively and efficiently. The more organized the leader is, the more effective a sprint will be and the more positive the experience will be for everyone.
    * Group Duties: The group in this context is working to help the leader attain some goal. It doesn't help the leader if tasks are being done incorrectly, so it is your responsibility to ask questions if you are unclear on what is expected or if you run into a situation not covered by the leader in the sprint briefing.

* **Brainstorming**:
    * Purpose: To get feedback on the lab about ideas that are in development and issues that are limiting progress. This could be getting feedback on question development, statistical approaches, or other activities.
    * Leader Responsibilities: The leader of a brainstorming session will need to prepare a presentation to help the group focus on the issue that the leader needs feedback on. This requires enough background and context for the group to understand both what the leader wants from the group and for the group to understand the scope of the problem at hand. The presentation does not need to be polished but it should be polished enough not to be distracting. The presentation should also be focused and no longer than 15 minutes. The group will engage better, and brainstorm better with you, through question and answer. 
   * Group Duties: Because the presentation for a brainstorm is necessarily shorter and less polished, comments should not focus on the style of the presentation, but the content. The group should remember that the goal of a brainstorming session is problem solving with in-progress work and should adjust expectations (and feedback) to the stage the work is in.

* **Inspire Sessions**:
    * Purpose: To communicate across the lab about research projects currently underway in the form of 5 minute lightning talks. The goal of these lab sessions is to help the group better understand what people are working on so that synergies among projects or researchers can be identified.
    * Leader Responsibilities: All or some subset of the lab will be tasked with giving a 5-minute talk during an Inspire Session. Every speaker is expected to give a 5 minute talk (and no longer!) on one of their projects that abides by the ESA Inspire guidelines. 
    * Group Duties: Enjoy and think about what projects have in common and what skills discussed in the talks might be useful for other projects in the lab.

* **Group Activities**:
    * Purpose: Activities to help break down barriers in the group.
    * Leader Responsibilities: These activities will be organized by Ethan or Morgan, but all weecologists are welcome to make suggestions for group activities.
    * Group Duties: Try to interact with members of the lab that you do not regularly work with.
