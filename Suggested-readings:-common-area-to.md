Weecologers,
we are such a different (and awesome) group, that we are shaping interests and experiences in very wide area. These expertise, I am sure, will help anyone of us to approach different methods, or ask more vibrant scientific questions. This page is thus meant to be an open document where to share any significant material we found interesting or potentially very useful (books, papers, notes, or slides).
The structure I am going to follow is the following:
{{field}}:,{kind of source}.{Author},**{title}**.{{availability}},{name of the weecologist proposing it}

For example, I'll start with a couple of nice machine learning references:
{machine learning}: Book. James et al., **An Introduction to Statistical Learning**, {available at http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/}, Sergio Marconi

{machine learning}: Slides. Nikolay Bliznyuk, **FALL 2016 ABE 6933 SEC 2080: Statistical (Machine) Learning**, {available on request to Sergio Marconi}, Sergio Marconi
