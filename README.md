## Weecology Lab Wiki

The weecology wiki is where we collaboratively document how to navigate life in the lab (and beyond) from choosing and pursuing a career path, to writing and reviewing papers, to using the high performance computing system and the printer.

This is the GitHub repository that stores all of the relevant code and content. The wiki is available at <https://wiki.weecology.org>

The site is built using [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/), the [Wowchemy Project Documentation template](https://github.com/wowchemy/hugo-documentation-theme), and the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/).

### Editing the wiki

All of the wiki content is stored in markdown files in the `content/docs/` directory.

* To edit from the GitHub repository find the associated page click the pencil icon to edit
* To edit from the website click the Edit this page link at the bottom of the page you want to edit and youâ€™ll be redirected to the GitHub repository to edit

In both cases when you are done editing add a descriptive commit message at the bottom of the page, select `Commit directly to the main branch`, and click the `Commit changes` button. If you want someone else to look at your changes before they are added to the wiki you can select `Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request` instead and click the `Propose changes` button and someone will review the changes before merging them into the wiki.
