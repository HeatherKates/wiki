Advice when applying to and interviewing for post doc positions

### Where to look
Allison Barner has very helpfully put together a google spreadsheet of postdoc fellowships (get your own money=freedom to do what you want):

There are also many sites where people who may already have money for a postdoc post ads (get paid from someone else's grant = less freedom to do what you want):

### General advice

### Good questions to ask

Working environment questions for other lab members:

"How has [adviser] changed since you first began working with them?"

"Is there anything you've been hoping [adviser] would have changed by now, but hasn't?"
