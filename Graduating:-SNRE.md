| Dissertation 1st Submission   | Mid semester                         | The dissertation does not have to be complete, or approved by all committee members at this point. This is mostly for a formatting check.                                                                                                                               |   |
| Oral Defense                  | Before Final dissertation submission |  Various forms need to be signed by the committee after a successful defense.                                                                                                                                |   |
| Dissertation Final Submission | Late in semester                     |  The dissertation must be *done* at this point and approved by all committee members.                                                                                                                               |   |
