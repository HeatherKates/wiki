This document outlines the official steps required by SNRE and the UF Grad school to graduate. 

Notes I'll be making as I move toward graduation. This will eventually compliment [these notes](https://github.com/weecology/lab-wiki/wiki/UF-Policies:-Graduating).

## SNRE Checklist
### Course requirements (See SNRE Plan of Study form for details)
* SNRE Seminar. Once while signed up for the 1 course credit, and once not signed up.
* A Principles of Ecology course. (note Shawn got this waived by having a BS in ecology).
* 1 each of a Natural Science, Social Science, and Sustainability course. 3 courses of Research/Methods. 
  For a list of which courses count toward these see [here](http://snre.ifas.ufl.edu/academics/graduate/courses-syllabi-and-curriculum/).

### Concentration
SNRE also requires a concentration. This encompasses 12 credit hours (at the PhD level, 6 for masters) of coursework. There is essentially a concentation for each department in the university, of which any can be chosen from. You then meet the requirement by taking 12 credits from that department. See the list [here](http://snre.ifas.ufl.edu/academics/graduate/courses-syllabi-and-curriculum/) under "Standard Concentrations". Alternatively you can just concentrations which have a more varied selection of courses, see the above page under "Concentrations that require additional hours". In either case, the credit hours that count toward a concetration also count for the other SNRE degree requirements. 

### Other requirements
* Presentation at the SNRE Seminar. You must present at the weekly SNRE seminar. This is no requiremnet on when this happens, but people generaly do it in their last semester and present some form of their defense. 

## Grad School Checklist
The UF Graduate school requires:

- 90 graduate level credit hours. 
- Passing the qualifying exam
- Passing the defense
- Submitting a correctly formatted dissertation.

All these steps are logged in the [Graduate Information Management Systems (GIMS)](https://gradschool.ufl.edu/gimsportal/gatorlink/portal.asp). They also have very strict deadlines outlined below. 

## Other Notes
Start discussing defense/graduation least 2 semesters *before* you intend to finish with:
* Your advisor
* Your committee
* Karen Bray - (Karen will ensure everything outlined above completed)  

Also let Karen know your defense date as soon as you know it. They will provide the set of forms which will be signed by your committee. 

## Final Semester Timeline

| Event                         | Deadline                             | Notes                                                                                                                          |   |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|
| Degree Application            | Early in semester                    | Submitted on ONE.UF                                                                                                                               |   |
| Submit Transmittal letter      | Before 1st dissertation submission   | this is a form signed only by your committee chair and submitted to Karen. It gives you access to make the 1st dissertation submission. |   |
| Dissertation 1st Submission   | Mid semester                         | The dissertation does not have to be complete, or approved by all committee members at this point. This is mostly for a formatting check.                                                                                                                               |   |
| Oral Defense                  | Before Final dissertation submission |  Various forms need to be signed by the committee after a successful defense.                                                                                                                                |   |
| Dissertation Final Submission | Late in semester                     |  The dissertation must be *done* at this point and approved by all committee members.    
| Dissertation Final Approval (aka Final clearance)   | End of semester                     |  The dissertation must be *accepted* by the dissertation office by this deadline. |   |

Deadlines change by a few days every semester but are generally around the same time. Official deadlines are available at the [Editorial Office](http://graduateschool.ufl.edu/about-us/offices/editorial/editorial-deadlines/) and the [Graduate School Academic Calendar](http://gradcatalog.ufl.edu/content.php?catoid=12&navoid=2681).

## Dissertation Submission
You'll go thru several rounds of submission. The first must be by the 1st submission deadline. In this case the dissertation does *not* have to be done, a single chapter will do. It's mostly a formatting check. You'll get feedback on this version which you'll need to implement in your final version.  
After your defense and the appropriate forms are submitted by Karen you can submit the full, 100% approved by your committee, version of your dissertation. This first "full" submission must be done by the "Final Submission Deadline".  
Once your final dissertation is submitted the dissertation office will likely return it with editing comments to do with formatting. You may go thru several rounds of this. You must address all their comments and have the dissertation *accepted* by their office by the Final Approval/Clearance deadline. Once it has this is done than the dissertation aspect is finished. 

## Other Graduation Requirements
**Proquest Agreement**  
Along with the other paperwork you'll fill out after defending, you'll get a UF Publishing Agreement form. This specified when you'd like UF to publish your dissertation and also which parts (either the full dissertation or just the abstract) UF will release to ProQuest, an online repository. Note that when you specify terms with Proquest you give them a non-exclusive licence to sell it, of which you're granted a 10% royalty of you earn > $25. If you'd like Proquest to publish it "open-access" there is a $95 fee.

It's unclear exactly what Proquest provides as the UF Library will host a copy of your dissertation as part of other fees you pay. If you want a bound copy of your dissertation Proquest does provide that (though several websites online do as well).

**Graduate Survey**  
The graduate office requires you to fill out a graduate survey administered by NSF. It's < 10 minutes and is mostly about prior schooling and future plants. It doesn't say it very well but all responses in this are optional. Link to survey as of 2019: [https://sed-ncses.org/](https://sed-ncses.org/).
