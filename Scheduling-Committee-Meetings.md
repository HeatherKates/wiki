#### Scheduling a time to meet

Committee meetings usually only need to be an hour long. 

It can be very tricky to find a time when all committee members are free (especially if there are 5 of them because of WEC). The process below is one way this can happen: 

* Email all members to ask which days within a 1-2 month range they're completely busy/traveling/unavailable. 
* Create a schedule form to figure out the specific times each member is available, restricting this to the days in which everyone is not completely unavailable. While Doodle polls can be used for this, [When Is Good] (http://whenisgood.net/) is actually easier to use for this matter. On the website, you create a calendar of possible days and times. The site creates a link to this calendar that you email to all committee members, and they fill it out by clicking on their available times (which will turn green). After they've all filled it out, you access the calendar with a unique code that shows how many and which members are available for each time period. If you're lucky, there will be at least one time period during which everyone is free. Huzzah! 
* Email all the members back letting them know what time the meeting is and where it will be held. 
* Faculty members generally seem to appreciate reminder emails about meetings about 24 hours in advance.
