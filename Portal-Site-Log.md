- We've determined that the clogged funnel EMC replaced in March 2014 was most likely causing the low hourly precipitation values we see from 2009 - 2014. The beginning of this time was an extreme drought (2009 and 2010). So these values were likely unaffected by the clogged funnel. And the drought may be when the funnel clogged (mud wasp nest?).

- We've determined that the rain gauge bucket size and funnel size are both wrong on the 2002 weather station (see calculations below) (2/1/2017)

- EMC did a measured water test to determine why the two rain gauges aren't agreeing (1/29/2017). The old station registered 1.6 and the new one registered 2.286 after pouring roughly 100ml in each. If we assume that the new station is right, it means 2.286 mm * 8.25 ml/tip / 0.254 mm/tip = 74.25 ml was poured into it. If a similar amount was poured in the old station, and we do the conversion using volume/tip for that rain gauge (4.73) in addition to the mm/tip (0.1) then we get: (74.25 ml / 4.73 ml/tip) * 0.1 mm/tip = 1.569767 mm. (close to 1.6).

- January 2016 - 2002 station's precip data does not match new station's precip data. It appears that the old station is programed for a different gauge than the one that is actually on it

- December 2016 - Weather station modem online

- November 2016 - Weather station collecting data

- August 2016 - new weather station erected, but not yet collecting data

- June 2016 - First new spectab caught in a while (EMC, Plot 11)

- March 2016 - Northern fence on Plot 24 rebuilt so stakes 16 and 17 and quadrat 17 are back inside the plot Woohoo!

- March 2015 - Half of plot treatments are flipped!!!

- A replacement funnel was ordered from Campbell Scientific, and installed on August 3 2014 by EMC

- While downloading weather station data in March 2014 it was noticed by EMC that the funnel 
had the tendency to clog, causing water to collect and potentially affect the data 
recorded by the station. She unclogs it (precip data looks much better after this point).

- October 2012 - We trap off-site in 3 regional areas with unique vegetation (riparian, grassy, non shrubs, cattle tanks), to determine the regional rodent pool

- January 11 - 13 2008 - The first spectab is caught on the site since 1999 (GMY) on plot 8, more will show up this year on plots 2, 9, 11, and 22.

- At the end of December 2002, the 1989 station was finally replaced with a new Campbell Scientific CR10x datalogger (2002 station) with a CS500-L Temperature/RH probe and a TE525MM-LL Rain Gage. The soil temperature probe was not replaced at this time

- In the latter years of its life, the 1989 station experienced occasional glitches which prevented data recording, and began having serious problems on February 10, 2002, that were left unresolved until the installation of a new datalogger

- Since 1989 the data have been recorded automatically using Campbellâ€™s xxxxxxxx station. Thus, there was 1 year in which both types of instruments were used simultaneously

- Between 1980 and 1989 data were recorded manually using instrumentation for which we lack information
