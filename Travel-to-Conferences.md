So, you're going to a conference? Conferences have slightly different rules because of registration costs.
Official UF language at end of page

**Step 0**: You will need to submit a TA BEFORE you spend funds.
          This is only true for conferences/workshops.
          Proceed to step 1
 
**Step 1**: Does your conference have registration costs?
          If yes, proceed to 2.
          If no, stop and go to Basic Travel Reimbursement

**Step 2**: Are you getting registration reimbursed?
         If yes, proceed to 3.
         If no, stop and go to Basic Travel Reimbursement

**Step 3**: Get Registration Documentation.    
UF needs to know if meals and housing are included in registration costs so they know they are not double reimbursing you for meals. (Yes, you still need to do this step if you are not planning on getting reimbursed for meals, because: bureaucracy). What they say they want: (from Fiona in WEC's office): Travel now requires that you attach a breakdown of the conference registration fee.  This is meant to show that there are no meals/social events/lodging included in the fee that we might inadvertently pay for.
    I've attached examples of what they will accept. Note, both of these files were sent as the documentation for the 2015 ESA meeting
* [Registartion form]( https://github.com/weecology/lab-wiki/blob/master/2015-ESA-Annual-Mtg-Reg-Form-04-06-15.pdf)
* [Statement from website about what was included in registration](https://github.com/weecology/lab-wiki/blob/master/ESA_registrationcoverage.pdf)



**Step 4**. Submit Travel Authorization
    When you send in your TA form, attach the registration documentation as well to the email

**After travel is completed**  

**Step 6**: Submit a [WEC Travel expense report](http://www.wec.ufl.edu/resources/travel/Travel%20Expense%20Report%201.2.pdf)  
    Email it to WECFiscal@ifas.ufl.edu

**Step 7**: Confirm Travel Expense Report is in the system  
    Login to my.ufl.edu and click on Main Menu -> My Self Service -> Travel and Expenses -> Expense Reports -> View  
    Leave everything blank and click Search to view all expense reports.

**Step 8**: Print the travel expense report signature page from my.ufl.edu and email signed version to WECFiscal@ifas.ufl.edu  
    On the page for the expense report click View Printable Version -> Print Expense Report  
    Current consensus is it only needs the Employee Signature

**Step 9**: Share Registration Documentation.
    Be kind and share with your labmates. Email the documentation to the lab list or share on Slack

Any issues or questions with the steps above can be resolved by asking [Fiona Hogan](fiona.hogan@ufl.edu)

[UF Documentation on PCARDS and Registration](http://www.purchasing.ufl.edu/departments/pcard/transactions/default.asp)
The PCard can only be used to pay registration fees for conferences, conventions, or seminars.

The PCard may be used when the registration fee includes meals or social events.  Optional events, those with separate fees, cannot be paid via PCard.  Optional events must be paid for by the traveler.

Because conference fees are typically paid in advance the cardholder must sign the registration confirmation to affirm the event is for official business.

Travel Authorizations, required for all travel relating to conferences/conventions, must be done BEFORE making charges.  The Travel Authorization number must be written on the payment documentation.

Please refer to UF's Travel Directives and Procedures for additional information.
