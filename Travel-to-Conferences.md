So, you're going to a conference? Conferences have slightly different rules because of registration costs.

Follow this handy guide to figure out what you need to do:

**Step 1**: Does your conference have registration costs?
          If yes, proceed to 2.
          If no, stop and go to Basic Travel Reimbursement

**Step 2**: Are you getting registration reimbursed?
         If yes, proceed to 3.
         If no, stop and go to Basic Travel Reimbursement

**Step 3**: Get Registration Documentation.
    UF needs to know if meals and housing are included in registration costs so they know they are not double reimbursing you for meals. (Yes, you still need to do this step if you are not planning on getting reimbursed for meals, because: bureaucracy). When you register you need this info: WHAT IS REGISTRATION COVERING. The question is, what does UF consider proof of this.
     What they say they want: (from Fiona in WEC's office): Travel now requires that you attach a breakdown of the conference registration fee.  This is meant to show that there are no meals/social events/lodging included in the fee that we might inadvertently pay for.
    I've attached examples of what they will accept: Note, both of these files were sent as the documentation for the 2015 ESA meeting:
        Registration form
        Statement from website about what was included in registration

**Step 4**. Submit Travel Authorization
    When you send in your TA form, attach the registration documentation as well to the email

**Step 5**: Share Registration Documentation.
    Be kind and share with your labmates. Email the documentation to the lab list or share on Slack
