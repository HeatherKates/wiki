Once you have been a resident of Florida for a year, you can petition to be reclassified as a Florida resident for tuition purposes.  This happens through the registrar's office, and involves a lot of paper.  Basically, you gather all the documents you can find that have your name, a Florida address, and a date at least one year ago, and hand in a packet to the Registrar.  I think the site says you need at least two documents, but it's much better to be over-prepared (if they deny your petition you may appeal, but this takes a long time and it's best to avoid it).  

Here is UF's official website about this: http://www.admissions.ufl.edu/afford/establishres

The documents that worked for me were: (everything should be a copy, they won't return these things to you)
* Florida drivers license
* Voter registration card
* Apartment lease (the whole thing, not just the cover page)
* Utility bills for past 12 months
* Renters insurance policy
