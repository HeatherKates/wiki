When you start at UF you won't be a Florida resident for tuition purposed (unless you already lived in Florida), and that is fine . Various graduate handbooks and forms say you must apply for Florida residency for tuition once you qualify, which is possible after living here for 1 year. There is no information on what would happen if you didn't do this, but it's probably bad (e.g., tuition is [$22,278 higher](http://www.sfa.ufl.edu/cost/) for non-resident undergrads than if they are officially residents).  

Once you have been a resident of Florida for a year, you can petition to be reclassified as a Florida resident for tuition purposes.  This happens through the registrar's office, and involves a lot of paper.  Basically, you gather all the documents you can find that have your name, a Florida address, and a date at least one year ago, and hand in a packet to the Registrar.  I think the site says you need at least two documents, but it's much better to be over-prepared (if they deny your petition you may appeal, but this takes a long time and it's best to avoid it).  

Here is UF's official website about this: http://www.admissions.ufl.edu/afford/establishres

The documents that worked for Erica were: (everything should be a copy, they won't return these things to you)
* Florida drivers license
* Voter registration card
* Apartment lease (the whole thing, not just the cover page)
* Utility bills for past 12 months
* Renters insurance policy

The people checking this read the law to the letter, which is something like "Legal documents showing residency of 12 months prior to the start of the semester". After talking with a few people it seems the easiest way to do this is, as soon as you move to Gainesville and before your 1st semester starts go get your Florida drivers license, car registration, and register to vote. At the start of your 2nd  year here these will then be legal docs that are dated 12 months from the present.   If you really want to drive it home you can also do the Declaration of Domicile

Shawn first submitted the following and got denied:
* Florida DL (not 12 months old, I got it in October my 1st semester).
* Most recent UFL paystub.
* Graduate assistantship letter from Ethan (showing the beginning date of 1 year prior).
* 1st page of my lease (dated more than 12 months prior).  

He went thru the appeal process and got approved submitting the following:  
* My *full* 12 page lease (My thinking was the 1st page was not a "legal document").  
* 12 months of rent check copes that my bank saves online.
