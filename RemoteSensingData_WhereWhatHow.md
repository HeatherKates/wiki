### Greetings to you all WEecologists! ###

As promised, no more procrastination and a bunch of interesting links and resources!

First but not best: http://daacmodis.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/MODIS/GLBVIZ_1_Glb/modis_subset_order_global_col5.pl
this is the famous **MODIS Global Subset** of which I am always talking about. 

the MODIS Global Subset is in fact only the top of the iceberg, speaking of data available from the ORNL DAAC web site... Which site? http://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dataset_lister.pl?p=11

If you are interested in Eddy Covariance data, they usually are more complicated to be given, at least in Europe. By the way, FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.ornl.gov) is the place you are looking for. Eddy Covariance Towers return half-hourly continuos data of several ecosystem scale important variables (GPP, NEE, Reco, NetRadiation, SWC, Wind direction and so on). To get data from here just go to "data", define your searching criteria, chose your sites, click on the data link banner, and pray for having access. For the European sites I used ICOS (Integrated Carbon Observation System) database (http://gaia.agraria.unitus.it/icos/nrt-data), hosted by my former University. The new database is still under construction, I guess, but I can ask more information if anyone is interested.

For those interested in phenology, there is this network I have heard about some years ago, but never accessed the data. The project was called PhenoCam (http://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/webcam/) and if I am not wrong there should be lots of data from North America and Japan.
Another interesting Data source may be AVIRIS, which returns hyper spectral data for plot/patch scale experiments. Never used so far, but sounds promising!
Last but not least, the European Forest Institute, a portal where is possible to find maps of main european tree species distribution and dominance: http://www.efi.int/portal/ 

Like I said, my Italian writing style hides the important information into an ocean of useless words.
Hence here's for you a super summary:
DAAC (data for anyone, mostly everywhere in North and South America
http://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dataset_lister.pl?p=11
MODIS (8days spatial data already elaborated for the variable of interest (biophysical or biochemical variables)
http://daacmodis.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/MODIS/GLBVIZ_1_Glb/modis_subset_order_global_col5.pl
PhenoCam (information about North America plant phenology; never used so far)
http://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/webcam/
AVIRIS (hyper spectral data, for site scale analyses; never used so far)

FLUXNET (Global network of Eddy Covariance towers)
http://fluxnet.ornl.gov
ICOS (European network of Eddy Covariance sites, database hosted by my previous affiliations)
http://gaia.agraria.unitus.it/icos/nrt-data
EFI (information about dominance, density and distribution of the main tree species throughout Europe)
