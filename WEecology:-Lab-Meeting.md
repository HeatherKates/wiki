## Overview
Lab meeting is designed to give Weecology members opportunities to gain and practice skills, obtain feedback, and interact with the broader research group.
* [A flowchart](https://github.com/weecology/lab-wiki/blob/master/uploads/flowchart.png) to help you decide what format works best for you.
* [A detailed description](https://github.com/weecology/lab-wiki/wiki/WEecology:-Lab-Meeting-Format-Description) of the different formats for lab meeting.
* (To be developed) [Templates]() to help you plan out your lesson/talk/presentation/sprint/etc.
  - Here is a [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12RS_PGXJ8-pSdakyIH1WZAsR90gWCRV4KdBzii2uy8o/edit?usp=sharing) for talks. It's set so that everyone can make comments on it, but not edit it directly -- if you wish to write up your feedback on a computer, please make a copy of the document for yourself.
