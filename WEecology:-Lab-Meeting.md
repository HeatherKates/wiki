  - Here is a [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12RS_PGXJ8-pSdakyIH1WZAsR90gWCRV4KdBzii2uy8o/edit?usp=sharing) for talks. It's set so that everyone can make comments on it, but not edit it directly -- if you wish to write up your feedback on a computer, please make a copy of the document for yourself.
