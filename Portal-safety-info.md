## Field emergencies
### Snakebites

If someone gets bitten by a rattlesnake, call 911. This will connect you to the Forest Service. You will need a helicopter to Tucson, because nearby hospitals don't carry antivenom.

### Less serious injuries

Drive to the hospital in Douglas.

## Zoonoses

(Renata thinks that) Nobody has ever contracted a disease because of fieldwork with the Portal rodents. 

We (Renata) assume there's risk of hantavirus, especially from the murid rodents. Don't disturb the woodrat midden, and avoid kicking up rodent-y dust.

The rodents have ectoparasites, but they don't seem to transmit to humans. 

Rabies is theoretically a risk, but RAs are constantly being bitten and there's never been an issue. 

### Humans

Alan's dogs notice anyone traveling on the road to the site off of Desert Willow. 

There are pepper spray guns in the driver and passenger door wells of the truck.

If you feel unsafe sleeping at the site, there are other places to camp. RAs have used Rusty's RV Ranch, and there are campsites up the canyon past Portal. The lodge is an option in a pinch.

There is a heavy Border Patrol presence in the area.
