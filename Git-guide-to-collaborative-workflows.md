## Intro
This is intended to be a default set of procedures for Weecologists to collaborate together using a Git/GitHub repository. For projects that are primarily being worked on by one person, this is probably unnecessary, but you may want to follow this anyway, so as to ingrain the workflow practices.

## Setup
*If you haven't done so already, do check out the onboarding [section with links to Git and Github resources](https://github.com/weecology/lab-wiki/wiki/New-Lab-Member-Onboarding-Guide#git-and-github).*
