## Getting started

* Follow guidelines for getting started on an ms (link out)
* Write an outline and share it with your collaborators. Ask for recommended changes. Get active/passive sign-offs. This will avoid extensive restructuring of papers later. 


* Work on a platform that allows simultaneous editing.
* Track changes. Even as lead author when responding to feedback. Makes it easier to others to quickly see what has changed.
* But know when to ditch change tracking...
