Using/scheduling lab space: For those of you who can effectively work from home, our general recommendation is that you continue to do so and let us support that through the purchase of anything that you need to make your home work space effective and ergonomic. However, working from home won't work for everything or for everyone, so here's our first draft of an approach for managing use of lab spaces for the fall semester. As with all other COVID-19 related lab policy we are 100% open to modifying this in response to feedback from members of the group.

1. Limit use of lab spaces to one person per room with a door, keeping the doors closed. Based on what we currently know about how COVID-19 spreads and the state of HVAC in the building we think it is safest to avoid the use of the open offices (Ellen, Henry, and Renata's current spaces). This leaves us with Morgan's office, Ethan's office, Room 3 (the large student/staff office with the door; I could be wrong about the number), the dry lab, which includes good desk space (and its own HVAC), and the unconference room. Folks  in the open offices are encouraged to make themselves at home in either Morgan and my offices (two workspaces available in each, the desks and the meeting tables) and the office space in the dry lab.
2. Schedule use of each space using a separate Google Calendar. There is now a separate calendar for each of these spaces and all of the local folks should have recently received a bunch of calendar invites (let me know if you didn't get them and I can check that I typed your email address correctly). Feel free to schedule single trips or recurring periods of time when you plan to be in each space. If you notice that someone else is regularly scheduling times when you would like to be in a particular space, then we'll need to figure out how to use the other available spaces to accommodate everyone. Either chat with each other or let @gmyenni know and she can facilitate.
3. We have three new folks joining the lab this fall (@Pat Dumandan @Alexis Irvin & @Brandon Grandison) how don't have established work spaces. Normally we'd figure out desk space for all of you now, but it's 2020, so not a lot of normal going on. If any of you want to start going in to the lab let @skmorgane or I know and we can chat about the different spaces and what  spaces are best for establishing a semi-regular workspace for the semester.
4. Do not go to the labs if you are feeling even the slightest bit sick, have recently been exposed to someone with COVID-19, or are currently waiting for a COVID-19 test result to come back.
5. Enter through the west door and exit via the east door.
6. Run fans while using the bathrooms.
7. Per [UF regulations](https://policy.ufl.edu/policy/masking-and-physical-distancing/), wear masks at all times while in the building unless you are in a private office (or alone in a room with the door closed).
