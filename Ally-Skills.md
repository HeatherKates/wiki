### Comments from respondents
* "This workshop was a great way to encourage people who already see themselves as allies to take the next step in their allyship. I think UF also needs some type of presentation that can be given at dept/faculty meetings, etc., about what is likely the precursor to this workshop: something that makes people very much aware of the need for allyship. It's possible that UF Multicultural and Diversity Affairs might have something like this available already."
* "I think everyone should have access to this workshop. Super enlightening and useful in the day-to-day."
* "Excellent workshop! Would love to see more workshops on how to make the classroom more inclusive"
* "PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BRING IT BACK-- EVERYONE NEEDS THIS WORKSHOP"
* "It was such a nice workshop and informative."
