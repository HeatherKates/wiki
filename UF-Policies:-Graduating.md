There's a lot of stuff to get done in the last semester or 2 of your PhD. Here are some tips.

## Contact Claire (or equivalent for SNRE)
As soon as you have a date for your dissertation that your committee agreed to, contact Claire and she will prepare the packet of forms you will need to have your committee sign. 

## Look up examples
You can search for and download recent dissertations from your department here: http://cms.uflib.ufl.edu/etd/searchuf
That way you can see what an acknowledgements section and a "bio sketch" are supposed to look like.

## The Graduate Editorial Office
Formatting will be annoying. There's an office to help you/tell you you're doing it wrong. I recommend downloading the dissertation template [here](http://helpdesk.ufl.edu/application-support-center/graduate-editorial-office/) and just pasting your own text into the appropriate sections. They seem to be moving pages around on their help website and breaking links all the time, but at this moment there are some examples of things like table of contents [here](http://graduateschool.ufl.edu/about-us/offices/editorial/format-requirements/). That page also has a dissertation checklist. 

## Exit seminar
You will be giving an exit seminar to the department during WEC's usual seminar time. I recommend making this as close as possible to your actual defense date with your committee -- theoretically your committee will go to your talk and then be prepared for your defense. As of Fall 2018 they are using a zoom room to record all the talks, which means you can invite people to join remotely with the link. 

## Odds and ends
* If you had a pcard, close it out by emailing the pcard team (pcard@ufl.edu) a few days before your last day. They will cancel it and you are supposed to shred it yourself.
