[WIP]
Once or twice during your tenure with Weecology there will probably be a hiring event for a student, postdoc, or staff member. As part of the hiring process, we bring people in for on-site interviews. On-site interviews give prospective weecologists the best feel for what we are about and what they might expect being in this group. It also gives us a chance to see if our work/training environment is one that will suit the needs of the potential weecologist.

## Interview Structure (and reasons)

A typical weecology interview is structured around individual (or small group) meetings with the members of the lab. This includes remote people as well as local individuals. The day will start with a breakfast meeting with Ethan and/or Morgan (depending on who the person will be working with) where the discussion is on how the more logistical/management aspects of the group. This serves as an orientation. Who are we, how do we manage our people, what is the advisor/supervisor's role (differs depending on whether the person is student,postdoc, or staff), what flexibility is there in the position, what is the hope/expectation for what the person filling the position will do/experience. The interviewee then meets with the other people in the lab and Ethan and Morgan will provide funds for lab members to take the interviewee to lunch. They will have a second meeting with their primary advisor/supervisor which will focus on the specifics of the position (if staff), general research discussion (if student), or a combination of the two (if postdoc). The day ends with dinner with Ethan and Morgan to allow the interviewee to ask any lingering questions that they have. This structure is grueling for everyone, but is serves several important purposes. One, it gives the interviewee repeated access to Ethan and Morgan, which helps develop rapport and a better sense of the applicant. It also provides them with dedicated time to focus on the environment they would be joining and the role they would be playing in that environment. The one-on-ones with lab members allow them to see the breadth of research, job goals, and experiences of people in the group to help them figure out if we would provide the type of experience they are looking for. It also allows us (Weecology) to see how interviewees interact with people from a range of backgrounds and experience levels.

## Lab Member Roles
The role of lab members is to provide general feedback about their interactions and perceptions of the interviewees.
