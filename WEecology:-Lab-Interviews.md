[WIP]
As part of the hiring process for students, postdoc, and staff we bring people in for on-site interviews. On-site interviews give prospective weecologists the best feel for what we are about and what they might expect being in this group. It also gives us a chance to see if our work/training environment is one that will suit the needs of the potential weecologist.

## Interview Structure

A typical weecology interview is one day and structured around individual (or small group) meetings with the members of the lab (including remote members). The day starts with a breakfast meeting with Ethan and/or Morgan (depending on who the person will be working most closely with), with the discussion focused on logistical and management aspects of the group. This serves as an orientation. Who are we, how do we manage our people, what is the advisor/supervisor's role, what flexibility is there in the position, what is the hope/expectation for what the person filling the position will do/experience. The interviewee then meets with the other people in the lab and Ethan and Morgan will provide funds for lab members to take the interviewee to lunch. They will have a second meeting with their primary advisor/supervisor which will focus on the specifics of the position (staff), general research discussion (students), or a combination of the two (postdocs). The day ends with dinner with Ethan and Morgan to allow the interviewee to ask any any additional questions that they have.

This structure serves several  purposes. It gives the interviewee repeated access to Ethan and Morgan, which helps develop rapport and a better sense of the applicant. It also provides them with dedicated time to focus on the environment they would be joining and the role they would be playing in that environment. The one-on-ones with lab members allow them to learn about the breadth of research, job goals, and experiences of people in the group to help them figure out if we would provide the type of environment they are looking for. It also allows us (weecology) to see how interviewees interact with people from a range of backgrounds and experience levels.

## Lab Member Roles

The role of lab members is to provide information to the interviewee and general feedback about their interactions and perceptions of the interviewees. Here are some things to think about while interacting with interviewees:

* Give them your honest feedback on the pros and cons of the group, working with Ethan and Morgan, Gainesville, UF, etc. Everyone has their own personal tradeoff landscape and we want people to make an informed decision to join us.
* One of the biggest issues we see in hiring at all levels (students, staff, faculty) is people making decisions based on whether they can see themselves hanging out with/being buddies with an interviewee. This is not an appropriate filter (we are hiring colleagues, not friends) and it is one of the primary ways that implicit bias can influence decision making and result in biased hiring. 
* This isn't to say that the person's character isn't important. We are a collaborative group with diverse interests and career goals. Things to look for: 
    * Do they seem supportive of diverse career pathways or dismissive of particular career goals?
    * Do they listen to you and respond in a professional manner or do they act like talking to you is a waste of time and say dismissive things about your research or other pursuits (not liking your favorite team/hobby is not the same as judging you negatively for having a hobby)?
    * Do they seem like they would work well in a collaborative environment - listen and think about different persepctives and engage proactively in discussions with you?
* Do their research interests align well with the group/funding support?
    * People who have done well/been happy in or group are often those with more general research interests. What does that mean? An example would be someone who is only interested in understanding rodents as opposed to using rodents to better understand general processes. We tend to be a general question/challenge oriented group and those more focused on studying a particular place or taxa have expressed feeling out of place.
    * Is there something in your interactions with the individual that makes you think our group is a particularly good fit or that they might do well with us but struggle in other workplaces/lab environments that they are more likely to run into? We don't make decisions solely on this, but we do weigh this when applicants are closely ranked.
