## Using the Pcard

So you're taking the big step and actually going to use the PCard. Not to scare you but the PCard is a big responsibility and the University takes using them correctly very seriously, so make sure to follow the flowchart below!

1) Are you making an item purchase (i.e. an object like a keyboard, paper, etc) or a travel related purchase (i.e. flight, registration, etc)

> Item Purchase: Jump to Step 2

> Travel Purchase: You need to also have a Travel Authorization submitted so that the travel costs can be associated with the travel approval. Go to the Travel Authorization pages and follow those instructions. Before proceeding to step 2.

2) Are you in a store or buying on the web?

> Store: Jump to step 3

> Web: Make sure that the site is not going to charge you sales tax. If it is you must stop immediately. There are other ways of purchasing from online vendors. If the vendor is on myUF Market (found on myufl) then you can follow [these guidelines](http://hr.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/instructionguides/Using%20PCard%20in%20myUF%20Market.pdf)

> Otherwise, talk to Ethan or Morgan about purchase orders through the department. If you are still making your online purchase, billing address can be found under general info. Proceed to step 4.

3) You are in a store. Are you in Florida or out of state?

> Florida: The University of Florida is exempt from paying sales tax and gets irritated about paying it. You need to make sure you have the tax exempt card with you so the store knows not to charge you sales tax. You should have received a card with your pcard but if not you can get one [here](http://www.fa.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/disbursements/fa-pds-cce.pdf ) . Show them your card and proceed to step 4.

> Out of State: Stay calm and carry on. Sales tax charges are ok if purchases are made out of state. Proceed to step 4.

4) I have my thing, now what?

> You have three, yes 3, days to submit your receipts to WEC. You need to fill out the PCard Invoice [form](http://www.wec.ufl.edu/resources/fiscal/Invoice%20Record.pdf)
> You can either take a picture of the receipt and email it with the invoice or hand everything in on paper to Fiona(?). If you are traveling, I would recommend taking a picture as soon as you get the receipt in your hand. You don't want to lose receipts. Trust me. 

Did you lose your receipt? Sigh. Proceed to step 5.

5) Uh, I lost my receipt. 

> People will be unhappy with you but it is not the end of the world. You need to fill out this [form](http://www.wec.ufl.edu/resources/fiscal/Replacement_Receipt_Form_2009-08.doc)  
> The form requires your supervisor (Ethan or I) to sign it. You will receive the stank eye from a variety of people. You will survive. 

6) I took longer than 3 days to submit my documentation

> I have no idea what happens to you now. When this happens to someone (and it inevitably will), let us know.
