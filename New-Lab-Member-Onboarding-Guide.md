# Intro

This guide is a general reference for being in the Weecology lab at UF. Some info is below, but much of it is actually located among the various lab-wiki pages, and linked to from here.

## How to Use

If you are a new member to the lab, please see the [issues](https://github.com/weecology/lab-wiki/issues) page of the lab wiki for the onboarding checklist. Make a new issue with your name and copy the list, and then be sure to go through it, referring back to the info here as necessary.

## Calendars

Once you have your weecology.org Google account, you will have access to the lab calendars. You can access these from a web browser at [https://calendar.google.com/](https://calendar.google.com/). (**Note that you may need to use the account management button in the upper-right corner if you are logged in with other Google accounts at the same time.**)

Please keep your personal calendar up to date on when you will be out of town to help with scheduling meetings. Ethan & Morgan will have viewing access to your calendar. Some calendars you might want to add to your view to stay informed are:
* "ethan" (Ethan White)
* "morgan" (Morgan Ernest)

The conference room schedule is under the portal1977@gmail.com account. You will need to send a request through the gmail calendar system to obtain access.

## Lab Meeting

(for Fall 2017) Mondays at Noon

Typical agenda is something like:
* general announcements
* short summary of past week from individuals present
* presentation of research (see [here](https://github.com/weecology/lab-wiki/wiki/Lab-Meeting) for the schedule)

### Lab Printer

The lab printer is located in room 015 and accessible from the UFL network at `10.242.89.254`. You may need to [download and install drivers](http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/product-support/product/dell-c3760dn/drivers) before adding it as a printer in order for it to function properly.
