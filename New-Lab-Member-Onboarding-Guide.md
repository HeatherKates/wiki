## Calendars

Once you have your weecology.org Google account, you will have access to the lab calendars. You can access these from a web browser at [https://calendar.google.com/](https://calendar.google.com/). (**Note that you may need to use the account management button in the upper-right corner if you are logged in with other Google accounts at the same time.**)

Please keep your personal calendar up to date on when you will be out of town to help with scheduling meetings. Ethan & Morgan will have viewing access to your calendar. Some calendars you might want to add to your view to stay informed are:
* "ethan" (Ethan White)
* "morgan" (Morgan Ernest)

See [here](https://github.com/weecology/lab-wiki/wiki/Lab-Meeting) for the weekly(?) lab meeting schedule.
