# Portal Trips


This page will (hopefully) remain an up-to-date list of future Portal trip dates: consider this an open invitation to lab members to come down and get involved in the data-collection process, as we always need one volunteer per trip.  Generally we fly out of Gainesville on a Thursday afternoon and return the following Monday afternoon.  If you see an open volunteer spot you would like to take, just email either Ellen or Erica to claim it!

## Trip Description
For those of you not familiar with the procedure, a Portal weekend consists of two nights of rodent trapping.  We fly out Thursday and stay overnight in Tucson. Friday morning we pick up the field truck and any supplies we need, and drive 3 hours to the site.  Friday night just before sunset we'll set traps on half of the site's 24 plots -- this procedure takes about 2 hours.  Saturday morning we get up just before dawn and process animals in the full traps.  The rodent RA (Erica or Ellen) will be the one actually handling the animals while the volunteer records data and assists with equipment.  Saturday night we'll set traps on the other half of the plots, and Sunday morning will be the same as Saturday morning.  Sunday afternoon we'll break camp and head back to Tucson, stay in a hotel again and fly back to Gainesville Monday morning.  

### Things a volunteer should bring:
* Sleeping bag
* Headlamp
* Hiking boots and thick field pants (lots of thorny plants at the site)
* Hat / long sleeve shirt for sun protection
* Water bottle


### Some other things to keep in mind: 
* This is a rustic camping situation, meaning no bathroom facilities and no water supply except what we bring in (we have several large jugs we can fill for drinking and washing dishes).  
* It may be quite cold in December - January (it has been known to freeze overnight)
* It will definitely be quite hot in May - August
* There may or may not be cell reception at the site (Verizon seems to do ok, although no 3G)
* If you love plants, consider coming down for our week-long plant censuses in March and August
