# Portal Trips


This page will (hopefully) remain up to date with a list of future Portal trip dates: consider this an open invitation to lab members to come down and get involved in the data-collection process, as we always need one volunteer per trip.  Generally we fly out of Gainesville on a Thursday afternoon and return the following Monday afternoon.  If you see an open volunteer spot you would like to take, just chat with either Ellen or Renata to claim it!

## Trip Description
For those of you not familiar with the procedure, a Portal weekend consists of two nights of rodent trapping.  We fly out Thursday and stay overnight in Tucson. Friday morning, we pick up the field truck and any supplies we need and drive 3 hours to the site.  Friday night just before sunset we'll set traps on half of the site's 24 plots -- this procedure takes about 2 hours.  Saturday morning we get up just before dawn and process animals in the full traps.  The rodent RA (Ellen or Renata) will be the one actually handling the animals while the volunteer records data and assists with equipment.  Volunteers can handle "exiled" rodents if they are interested.  Saturday night, we'll set traps on the other half of the plots, and Sunday morning will be the same as Saturday morning.  Sunday afternoon, we'll break camp and head back to Tucson, stay in a hotel again, and fly back on Monday morning.  

### Things a volunteer should bring:
* Sleeping bag (and sleeping pad, though we have some extras in the truck)
* Headlamp
* Hiking boots
* Field pants (lots of thorny plants at the site)
* Long sleeve shirt for sun protection
* Hat/sunglasses (for shade from the sun, and also for the chilly evenings/mornings)
* Water bottle
* Rain jacket
* Chapstick
* Something to keep yourself occupied during down time (book, music, etc.)

### Some other things to keep in mind: 
* We take care of all the food and related items (you don't need to bring coffee, snacks, plates, utensils, etc. unless you want to)
* This is a rustic camping situation, meaning no bathroom facilities and no water supply except what we bring in (we have several large jugs we can fill for drinking and washing dishes).  
* It may be quite cold in December - January (it has been known to freeze overnight)
* It will definitely be quite hot in May - August
* There is somewhat limited cell reception at the site, depending on your carrier
* If you love plants, consider coming down for our week-long plant censuses in March and August
