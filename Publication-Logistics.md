## Cover letter

All cover letters consist of: 
- a business header (name of Editor in Chief, their professional address)
- a description consisting of the manuscript title, authors, and what 'type' of article it is being submitted as for consideration (e.g., Report, Methods, Ideas and Concepts, Article, this varies from  journal to journal and some journals do not have different types of article)
- a brief description of the manuscript (1 paragraph). For many journals, this description should convey either implicitly or explicitly why this article is of interest to the readership of this journal. If going to a general ecology journal like Ecology/Ecology Letters/AmNat then this description should focus on the aspects of your work that a general readership would find interesting. If going to GEB then focus on the general interest and global nature of the study. etc etc. 
- Any assurances or statements the journal requires (i.e. not submitted elsewhere, etc).

You letter should not be longer than 1 page, including the header material and your 'signature' at the bottom (don't need to literally sign it).

Here are some examples of cover letters

## Dealing with reviews
When you get your reviews back, the next step is to figure out how to handle them. Typically reviewers will have major and minor criticisms. Your task is to sort through those criticisms and figure out a plan for addressing them. Reviewers are only human and they are not infallible. Their criticisms will fall into one of three categories: useful, neutral, and wrong. You are not required to do everything a reviewers tells you to do. Ethan and Morgan's philosophy (which we got from our advisor) is that if it doesn't harm the research/manuscript you do whatever a reviewer requests (i.e. everything in the neutral/good categories). If you think what the reviewer has suggested is majorly problematic, then we generally advise not doing it. In your response to the reviewers you can explain why you disagree with their suggestion/criticism. You want to choose judiciously when to stand your grand in the review process. Discussion with your co-authors/advisers is warranted.

When you resubmit your manuscript, you will also submit a detailed response to the reviewers. To construct this, cut and paste the reviews into a new document. Into this document you will write your response to each individual issue the reviewer brings up. Often reviewers will construct their reviews so that each paragraph is focused on a separate distinct issue, if not, you can break their paragraphs accordingly. Keep all of their comments in the document so it is clear you did not edit out any of their concerns. We find that a good starting place for your revision is sitting down with the document and thinking about how you would/should respond to each of these items and start writing in ideas/responses. Then you can use your responses as a template for making the changes in your manuscript.

Examples of Response to Reviewers:

## Response to editor
When you resubmit you will also submit a cover letter to the editor. This is distinct from the detailed response to reviewers. The cover letter will consist of 2 main parts:
- a statement similar to the first one in your cover letter stating the name of the manuscript and the authors and that you have revised your manuscript and are resubmitting it.
- a paragraph overviewing the changes you made in response to the reviews - in this paragraph you only really need to discuss what seem like the major concerns - especially if the editor highlighted them in their decision letter.

Examples of Resubmission letters:

## Managing co-authors

Do not forget your co-authors through this process. You do not have to go through this on your own. They can help you brainstorm how to deal with difficult issues, help run analyses to deal with concerns, help draft language for the response letter or implement revisions to the manuscript. 

Hopefully you have a good relationship with your co-authors and they are actively engaged, however often co-authors are more peripheral to a project, had a limited role in the analyses/manuscript. It can be easy to forget them as you manage all the moving parts of the review process. Professionally, however, you need to make sure they are ok with the manuscript during all the phases of this process. Here's a checklist to help you remember when to reach out to your collaborators:

- ALWAYS have all co-authors sign off on the final version of the manuscript before submitting. 
- When you receive the reviews and response from the journal, forward it on to your co-authors, even if you are not yet ready to discuss how to handle the comments. If you wait, you'll forget and then you'll be racing a deadline to resubmit without having co-authors engaged.
- It is encouraged to discuss the plan for responding to reviewer critiques with co-authors. Depending on the specifics of the collaboration, different approaches to this may be warranted. You may draft the response to reviewers and send them out for comments. During the drafting process you may also assign specific comments to specific co-authors if the criticism is really pertinent to their role on the manuscript. 
- ALWAYS get co-authors to sign off on the final version of the response and manuscript before resubmitting. 
- ALWAYS share the good news when it is accepted. Everyone likes good news. Don't hog it for yourself. :)
