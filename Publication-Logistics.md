## Cover letter

All cover letters consist of: 
- a business header (name of Editor in Chief, their professional address)
- a description consisting of the manuscript title, authors, and what 'type' of article it is being submitted as for consideration (e.g., Report, Methods, Ideas and Concepts, Article, this varies from  journal to journal and some journals do not have different types of article)
- a brief description of the manuscript (1 paragraph). For many journals, this description should convey either implicitly or explicitly why this article is of interest to the readership of this journal. If going to a general ecology journal like Ecology/Ecology Letters/AmNat then this description should focus on the aspects of your work that a general readership would find interesting. If going to GEB then focus on the general interest and global nature of the study. etc etc. 
- Any assurances or statements the journal requires (i.e. not submitted elsewhere, etc).

You letter should not be longer than 1 page, including the header material and your 'signature' at the bottom (don't need to literally sign it).
